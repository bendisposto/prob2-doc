This page explains how to run the distributed model checking prototype.

Note that the implementation does not work with Windows, only Linux
andMac OS are supported.

It is required to set the limits for shared memory on some systems, this
can be done using sysctl. Here is a little script that sets the limits.
It takes the size of shared memory as parameter (usually the size of
your memory in GB). You need to run the script with root rights.

`#!/bin/bash` +
`if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then` +
`    echo ````Setting`` ``SHM`` ``sizes:`'' +
`    sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmmax=\`perl -e ````print`` ``1073741824*$1`''`\`` +
`    sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmseg=4096` +
`    sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmall=\`perl -e ````print`` ``262144*$1`''`\`` +
`    echo ````Here`` ``are`` ``the`` ``current`` ``values:`'' +
`    sysctl -a | grep shm` +
`else` +
`    echo ````You`` ``need`` ``to`` ``provide`` ``the`` ``size`` ``of`` ``shared`` ``memort`` ``(in`` ``full`` ``GB)`'' +
`fi`

After setting up shared memory, you can use the `parB.sh` script that
comes with the ProB distribution (see link:/Download[Download]).

Usage

`./parB <Nr. of workers> `` `

Example usage:

`$ ./parB.sh 2 ~/parB.log scheduler.mch`

Running in the Cloud/Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The script can only be used for computation on a single physical
computer. If you want to use multiple computers, the setup is a bit more
complex:

* On each physical computer you need to start exactly one copy of
`lib/hasher`.

`lib/hasher `` `` 1`

* Multiple Copies of `probcli` configured as workers:

`probcli -zmq_worker2 `` `` 0`

* A single instance of `probcli` configured as the master:

`probcli -zmq_master2 `` `` ``  0 `` `

The minimal queue length is used to determine if a worker is allowed to
share its queue. The experiments have shown, that a number between 10
and 100 is fine. parB will stop after (at least) the maximal number of
states have been explored, a value of -1 will explore all states (beware
of this, if the state space is infinite!).

As a rule of thumb use one real core for each of the processes. On
hyperthreads the model checking still becomes faster, but the speedup is
only 1/4 for each additional hyperthread.

We plan to develop a control interface that allows configuring the
logical network in a more convenient way and running the model checker
from within ProB.

[[options]]
Options
~~~~~~~

You can use preferences in parB.sh (and the master) :

`./parB <Nr. of workers> `` `` ` +
` ./probcli `` -zmq_master2 `` `` ``  0 `` `` `

If you use -strict, parB will stop as soon as a violation is found,
otherwise parB will explore the full state space (up to the maximal
number of states)

Cleaning up
~~~~~~~~~~~

If something goes wrong it may be necessary to clean up your shared
memory. You can find out if there are still memory blocks occupied using
`ipcs`. Removal can be done using:

`ipcrm -M \`ipcs | grep `` | grep -o ````0x[^`` ``]*`''` | sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/ -M /g'\``
