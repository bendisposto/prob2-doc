A deferred set in B is declared in the SETS Section and is not
explicitly enumerated. In the example below, AA is a deferred set and BB
is an enumerated set.

....
MACHINE M0
SETS AA; BB={bb,cc,dd}
END
....

ProB in general requires all deferred sets to be given a finite
cardinality before starting animation or model checking. If no
cardinality is specified, a default size will be used (which is
controlled by the `DEFAULT_SETSIZE`
link:/Controlling_ProB_Preferences[preference]).

In general (for both probcli and ProB Tcl/Tk) you can set the
cardinality of a set AA either by

* making it an enumerated set, i.e., adding `AA = {v1,v2,…}` to the SETS
clause
* adding a predicate `card(AA) = constant` to the PROPERTIES clause
* Note: various other predicates in the PROPERTIES clause will also
influence the size used for AA by ProB, for example:

`     - card(AA) > 1` +
`     - aa:AA & bb:AA & aa/=bb` +
`     - AA = {aa,bb} & aa/=bb` +
`     - …`

* you can add a DEFINITION `scope_AA == constant` to instruct ProB to
set the cardinality of AA to the constant.

Using Refinement for Animation Preferences
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note: instead of adding AA = \{aa,bb} to the SETS clause you can also
add `AA = {aa,bb} & aa/=bb` to the PROPERTIES clause. This can also be
done in a refinement. A good idea is then to generate a refinement for
animation with ProB (which may contain other important settings for
animation):

....
REFINEMENT M0_ProB REFINES M0
CONSTANTS aa,bb
PROPERTIES
AA = {aa,bb} & aa/=bb

Setting Deferred Set Cardinalities within probcli
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From the command-line, using probcli you can use the command-line
switch:

`-card `` `

Example:

`probcli my.mch -card PID 5`
