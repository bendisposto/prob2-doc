The ProB Cli (command-line interface) offers many of the ProB features
via command-line. As such, you can run ProB from your shell scripts or
in your Makefiles. probcli contains a REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) and
you can also https://github.com/bivab/prob.vim[integrate probcli into an
editor such as vim]. probcli can also communicate with other tools or
graphical user interfaces via sockets (this is used by
link:/ProB_for_Rodin[ProB for Rodin]).
