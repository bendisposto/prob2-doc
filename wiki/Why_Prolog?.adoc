/Category:Developer_Manual[Category:Developer Manual] __NOTOC__ In this
chapter we try to answer the question: why did we use Prolog to develop
the core of ProB, and in particular why do we use the commercial
http://www.sics.se/isl/sicstuswww/site/index.html[SICStus Prolog] rather
than an open-source alternative.

The short answer is that Prolog allows us to flexibly implement various
specification formalisms as well as the analysis and verification tools
that go along with it. At the same time, Prolog is very fast and SICStus
Prolog is one of the fastest and most stable Prolog systems, allows
access to more than 256 MB of heap even on 32 bit systems (important for
model checking), and is easy to interate with other programming
languages (so that the GUI does not have to be developed in Prolog).

[[why-prolog]]
Why Prolog
~~~~~~~~~~

* Prolog is a convenient language in which to express the semantics of
other languages.

::
  In particular, high-level languages with non-determinism can be
  expressed with an ease that is hard to match by other languages. For
  example, the ProB source code to encode the semantics of the internal
  choice (encoded internally as '|') from CSP is basically as follows:

`cspm_trans('|'(X,_Y),tau,X).` +
`cspm_trans('|'(_X,Y),tau,Y).`

::
  The full operational semantics of CSP from Roscoe's book has been
  translated mostly one-to-one into Prolog rules (adding treatment for
  source location information,...).

* Prolog is (one of) the most convenient languages to express program
analysis

::
  (e.g., abstract interpretation or even dataflow analysis, see also
  last chapters of 2nd edition of the Dragon book), program verification
  (e.g., model checking), and program transformation (e.g., partial
  evaluation) in. Also, type inference and type checking are a
  ``breeze'' thanks to Prolog's unification.

* Modern Prolog systems support a feature called ``co-routining'',

::
  also known as flexible computation rules or delay-declarations. These
  can be implemented by block-declarations or when-statements and they
  can stipulate conditions under which a Prolog goal should be expanded.
  For example, the following block declarations say that the goal
  less_than_equal should only be expanded when both of its arguments are
  known:

`:- block less_than_equal(-,?), less_than_equal(?,-).` +
`less_than_equal(X,Y) :- X=<Y.`

::
  A nice aspect is that the block declarations do *not* influence the
  declarative semantics of a Prolog program because of the theorem which
  states that the declarative semantics of logic programs is independent
  of the selection rule.

I believe this to be one of the ``killer'' features of modern Prolog
systems. We heavily use this in the ProB kernel to delay enumeration of
values and to implement our own constraint solver over sets and
relations. In my experience, this feature allows one to write much more
declarative code than with traditional Prolog systems (an example is the
transcription of Roscoe's operational semantics mentioned above), while
often obtaining a dramatic increase in performance in generate-and-test
scenarios.

* Prolog is fast.

::
  This may be surprising to some as Prolog sometimes has a reputation of
  being slow. On the laptop used for the experiments below, SICStus
  Prolog can perfrom 33 Million logical inferences per second (on my
  very latest laptop in can actually perform 75 Million logical
  inferences per second in 64-bit mode). As you see below, it can
  sometimes be faster than Java. Modern Prolog systems are well tuned
  and developed, and will outperform your own logical inference or
  unification mechanism by a considerable margin (I observed a factor of
  10,000 between SICStus Prolog and the C implementation of a custom
  rule engine in a commercial product).

In summary, Prolog gives us both a flexible way to encode both the
operational semantics of many high-level formalisms (B, Z, CSP, ...) and
various flexible tools on top such as animation, type checking, model
checking and refinement checking.

All of this comes with a respectable performance, despite the
flexibility of the approach.

There are of course still aspects with Prolog that, despite many years
of research and development, are not ideal. Standardisation of Prolog
and the libraries is not ideal (the ISO standard does not cover the
module system for one). There is no standard static type checking tool.

[[why-sicstus-prolog]]
Why SICStus Prolog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is a short summary of some of the Prolog systems that to my
knowledge are still being actively maintained (please email me
corrections and additions).

SICStus:

* + Fast, good support
* + Standalone binaries
* + >256 MB Heap on 32 Bit systems
* + C, Java, TclTk external interfaces,
* + Good libraries (from Quintus)
* + fast co-routines and constraint solving
* - commercial product (with academic site licences available)
* - no multi-threading

SWI

* + Actively maintained
* + Large number of libraries and features
* + Support for co-routines and constraint solving
* - still slow

Ciao

* + comes with CiaoPP analyser for static analysis
* + good module system
* + relatively fast
* + decent support for co-routines and constraint solving
* - Long startup time

Gnu Prolog

* + good Constraint solving
* - No co-routines
* - limited features and libraries
* - no BigInts

XSB Prolog:

* + Tabling
* + Prolog facts can be used as efficient relational database
* - non-standard built-ins (no print, ... quite ≠ from SWI, ...)
* - no co-routines nor constraint solving
* - no BigInts

Yap

* + fast
* - no finite domain constraint solver
* - no BigInts
* - only C external language interface

LPA

* + good graphical tools, GUI generation, ...
* - runs only Windows
* - no modules
* - no co-routines

BinProlog

* - no Bigints
* - commercial

B Prolog

* - no Bigints prior to version 7.6, but now available
* + constraint-based graphics library
* - commercial (but free academic license)
* + has action-rule mechanism (which apparently is a co-routining
mechanism; I have not yet been able to experiment with it)

Other Prologs with which I have not directly experimented are: Visual
Prolog and IF Prolog.

It seems that maybe Yap and SWI are merging efforts. It would be nice to
have a Prolog system with the features of SWI and the speed of YAP. This
would be a serious (free) alternative to SICStus Prolog.

[[a-small-benchmark]]
A small benchmark
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below I have conducted a small experiment to gauge the performance of
various Prolog systems. I do not claim that this example is
representative; it tests only a few aspects of performance (e.g., speed
of recursive calls). I don't have the time to do a more extensive
evaluation at the moment.

The benchmark is the Fibonacci function written in the naive recursive
way so as to quickly obtain a large number of recursive calls. The
advantage is that the code can be easily transcribed into other
programming languages. Below, I give you also a Python, a Haskell, and a
Java version using BigInts. The benchmarks were run on a MacBook Pro
Core2 Duo with 2.33 GHz. BinProlog does not have a demo licence for Mac;
hence I had to run the Windows version in Parallels. LPA Prolog only
runs on Windows; so it was also run using Parallels. Note: the purpose
of the benchmark was to measure the performance of recursion. As such, I
was trying to use the same types of data on all platforms (BigInts).
Also note that this is actually not a typical Prolog ``application'' as
no use is made of unification or non-determinism. But it is a good
application for a functional programming language such as Haskell since
Fibonacci is a pure function without side-effects.

Also, I do not claim that the benchmark shows that Prolog is faster than
Java in general. My only claim is that if an application is well suited
to Prolog, its performance can be surprisingly good. I also have the
feeling that Haskell has made great strides in performance recently, and
that the Prolog community should be on its guard (so as not to be left
behind).

`System         BigInts            Fib(30)      Fib(35)` +
`Java 1.5.0_16          NO (long)       0.020        0.231` +

`LPA 4.710      yes         1.736       36.250`

The same table with only the BigInteger versions is:

`System         BigInts            Fib(30)      Fib(35)` +
`GHC 6.10.1     yes         0.082        0.878` +
`SICStus 4.0.4          yes         0.240        2.640` +
`Ciao 1.13.0        yes         0.312        3.461` +
`Java 1.5.0_16          yes         0.445        4.898` +
`Python 2.5.1           yes         0.760        8.350` +
`SWI 5.6.52     yes         1.900       20.990` +
`LPA 4.710      yes         1.736       36.250`

I have also recently tested B Prolog 7.4. It seems to perform marginally
faster than SICStus (3 %), but does not support BigInts. Note, that Gnu
is the only system requiring tweaking of parameters:

`export TRAILSZ=200000` +
`export GLOBALSZ=1500000`

Java with int rather than BigIntegers takes 0.016 s for Fib(30) and
0.163 s for Fib(35). Note that GHC Haskell seems to have received a big
performance boost on this particular example (earlier versions of
Haskell were on par with SICStus Prolog).

I also wanted to experiment with a Mercury version, but for the moment
Mercury does not compile/install on my machine. Marc Fontaine has also
written various Haskell versions of Fibonacci

Here are the various versions of Fibonacci:

Prolog Version:

`fib(0,1) :- !.` +
`fib(1,1) :- !.` +
`fib(N,R) :-` +
` N1 is N-1, N2 is N1-1, fib(N1,R1), fib(N2,R2),` +
` R is R1+R2.`

Python Version:

`def Fib(x):` +
`    if x<2:` +
`        return 1` +
`    else:` +
`        return Fib(x-1)+Fib(x-2)`

Java Version with BigInteger:

`private static BigInteger ZERO = BigInteger.ZERO;` +
`private static BigInteger ONE = BigInteger.ONE;` +
`private static BigInteger TWO = new BigInteger(````2`''`);` +
`public static BigInteger naiveFib(BigInteger x) {` +
` if (x.equals(ZERO) ) return ONE;` +
` if (x.equals(ONE) ) return BigInteger.ONE;` +
` return naiveFib(x.subtract(ONE)).add(naiveFib(x.subtract(TWO)));` +
`}`

Haskell Version:

`fib :: Integer -> Integer` +
`fib n` +
` | n == 0    = 1` +
` | n == 1    = 1` +
` | otherwise = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`

Java Version with long rather than BigIntegers:

`public static long fib(long xx) {` +
` if (xx<2)` +
`   return 1;` +
` else` +
`   return fib(xx-1)+fib(xx-2);` +
`}`

[[startup-times]]
Startup Times
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below we test the startup times of some of the Prolog systems.
Unfortunately, not all Prolog systems can easily be started as easily
from the command-line as SICStus Prolog (e.g., --goal ``GOAL.''
parameter and -l FILE parameter).

First, the following command takes 0.026 s real time (0.015 s user time)
with SICStus Prolog 4.0.5 on the same system as above:

`time sicstus --goal ````halt.`''

For SWI Prolog 5.6.64, we get 0.015 s real time (0.008 s user time):

`time swipl -g ````halt.`''

For Ciao Prolog 1.13.0-8334, we get 0.271 s user time for ``time ciao''
and then typing halt (I found no easy way to provide goals on the
command-line).

Now, take the file halt.pl with contents:

`main :- print(hello),nl,halt.` +
` :- main.`

The following takes 0.028 seconds real time and 0.015 seconds user time.

`time sicstus -l halt.pl`

The following takes 0.204 seconds real time the first time and 0.015
seconds real time the second time:

`time swipl -c halt.pl`

The following takes 0.726 seconds real time and 0.648 seconds user time
(after commenting out :- main.), i.e., 25 times slower than SICStus:

`time ciao -c halt.pl`
