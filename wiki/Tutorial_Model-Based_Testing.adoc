link:/Tutorial_Model_Checking,_Proof_and_CBC[Tutorial_Model_Checking,_Proof_and_CBC].

Let us examine the following B model:

....
MACHINE SimpleAccount
CONSTANTS minb,maxb
PROPERTIES
 minb < maxb &
 minb <= 0 &
 maxb >= 0 & maxb > 1000
VARIABLES balance
INVARIANT
 balance: minb..maxb
INITIALISATION balance:=0
OPERATIONS
  Deposit(s) = SELECT s>0 & balance+s<= maxb THEN balance := balance + s END;
  Withdraw(s) = SELECT s>0 & balance-s >= minb THEN balance := balance - s END;
  NoWithrawalPossible = SELECT balance = minb THEN skip END;
  NoDepositPossible = SELECT balance = maxb THEN skip END
END
....

In model-based testing you want to generate traces for your model which
satisfy a certain coverage criterion. Currently, ProB basically supports
one coverage criterion: operation coverage, i.e., ProB tries to cover
all operations (aka events for Event-B).

There are two ways this coverage can be achieved systematically: using
model checking or using a constraint-based approach.

Select the ``Stop when all OPERATIONS Covered'' check box in the model
checking dialog:

Press the ``Model Check'' button; after a short while ProB should
respond with
