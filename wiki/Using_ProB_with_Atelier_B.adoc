/Category:User_Manual[Category:User Manual] __NOTOC__ As of version 1.3,
ProB contains a much improved parser which tries be compliant with
Atelier B as much as possible.

[[extra-features-of-prob]]
Extra Features of ProB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Identifiers: ProB also allows identifiers consisting of a single
letter. ProB also accepts enumerated set elements to be used as
identifiers.

* Lexing: The Atelier-B parser (`bcomp`) reports a lexical error
(`illegal token |-`) if the vertical bar (|) of a lambda abstraction is
followed directly by the minus sign.

* Typing:
** ProB makes use of a unification-based type inference algorithm. As
such, typing information can not only flow from left-to-right inside a
formula, but also from right-to-left. For example, it is sufficient to
type `xx<:yy & yy<:NAT` instead of typing both `xx` and `yy` in ProB.
** Similar to Rodin, ProB extracts typing information from all
predicates. As such, it is sufficient to write `xx/:{1,2}` to assign a
type to `xx`.
** the fields of records are normalized (sorted); hence the predicate
`rec(a:0,b:1) = rec(b:y,a:x)` is correctly typed for ProB.

* DEFINITIONS: the definitions and its arguments are checked by ProB. We
believe this to be an important feature for a formal method language.
However, as such, every DEFINITION must be either a predicate, an
expression or a substitution. You *cannot* use, for example, lists of
identifiers as a definition. Also, for the moment, the arguments to
DEFINITIONS have to be expressions. Finally, when replacing DEFINITIONS
the associativity is not changed. E.g., with `PLUS(x,y) == x+y`, the
expression `PLUS(2,3)*10` will evaluate to 50 (and not to 32 as with
Atelier-B).

* for a LET substitution, Atelier-B does not allow introduced
identifiers to be used in the right-hand side of equations; ProB allows
`LET x,y BE x=2 & y=x*x IN ... END`

* ProB allows WHILE loops and sequential composition in abstract
machines

* ProB now allows the IF-THEN-ELSE for expressions with parentheses
around it: `(IF x<0 THEN -x ELSE x END)`

[[limitations]]
Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Parsing: ProB will require parentheses around the comma, the
relational composition, and parallel product operators. For example, you
cannot write `r2=rel;rel`. You need to write `r2=(rel;rel)`. This allows
ProB to distinguish the relational composition from the sequential
composition (or other uses of the semicolon).

* link:/Well-Definedness_Checking[Well-definedness]: ProB will try to
check if your predicates are well-defined during animation or model
checking. For this ProB assumes (similar to Rodin) a stricter
left-to-right definition of well-definedness than Atelier B.

* Closure: The transitive and reflexive closure operator of classical B
is not supported as defined in the B-Book by Abrial. AtelierB also does
not support the operator as defined in the B-Book (as this version
cannot be applied in practice). For the reflexive component of closure,
ProB will compute the elements in the domain and range of the relation.

Note however, that the transitive closure operator `closure1` is fully
supported, and hence one can translate an expression `closure(e)`, where
e is a binary relation over some domain d, into the expression
`closure1(e) \/ id(d`).

* Unsupported Operators:
** Trees and binary trees: most but not all tree operators (mirror,
infix) are supported yet (the `STRING` type is now supported);
** `VALUES`: This clause of the `IMPLEMENTATION` machines is not yet
supported;

* There are also some general limitations wrt refinements. See
link:/Current_Limitations#Multiple_Machines_and_Refinements[Current
Limitations#Multiple Machines and Refinements] for more details.
