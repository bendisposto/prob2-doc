* the max number of initializations computed,
* the max number of times that an operation may be enabled,
* the time out for the computing of enabled transitions (in ms),
* the size of unspecified deferred sets in the SETS section,
* the MAXINT,
* the MININT,
* how many levels of refined models are animated by default,
* if the software should try more aggressively to detect expressions
that are not well-defined,
* if the software should use the CLP(FD) solver for B integers,
* if there should be lazy expansion of lambdas and set comprehensions,
* if the lazy form should be converted back into explicit form for
variables, constants, and operation arguments,
* if a small main window should be used for ProB,
* if the B source code should be shown,
* if the trace for each event should be stored,
* if top-level ANY variable values of B Operations without parameters as
parameters should be shown,
* if the effect of initialization and setup constants in the operation
name should be shown,
* if operations which are skip or PRE C THEN skip should be animated,
* if the outermost PRE should be treated as SELECT,
* if operations should be required to assign to all outputs.
