ProB is a flexible and extensible validation tool for high-level
specification formalisms. ProB supports

* multiple languages: B, Z, CSP, Event-B, Promela, dSL, ...
* and multiple validation techniquesâ€¨: animation, model checking, ...

Below we present a gentle introduction to ProB focusing on classical B
(but many of the commands are also applicable to the other formalisms
such as CSP, Event-B and Z).
