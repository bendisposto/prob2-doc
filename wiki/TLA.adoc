Using ProB for Animation and Model Checking of TLA+ specifications
------------------------------------------------------------------

The http://nightly.cobra.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/tcl/[latest version of
ProB] uses the translator TLA2B, which translates the non temporal part
of a
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tla.html[TLA+]
module to a B machine. To use ProB for TLA+ you have to download the TLA
tools. They are released as an open source project, under the
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/license.html[MIT
License]. In the ProB Tcl/Tk GUI you have to select the menu command
``Download and Install TLA Tools'' in the Help menu.

When you open a TLA+ module ProB generates the translated B machine in
the same folder and loads it in the background. If there is a valid
translation you can animate and model check the TLA+ specification.
There are many working examples in the 'ProB/Examples/TLA+/'-directory.

There is also an
http://www.stups.uni-duesseldorf.de/w/Special:Publication/HansenLeuschelTLA2012[iFM'2012
paper] that describes our approach and performs some comparison with
TLC. Our link:/ProB_Logic_Calculator[online ProB Logic Calculator] now
also supports TLA syntax and you can experiment with its predicate and
expression evaluation capabilities.

[[tla2b]]
TLA2B
-----

The parser and semantic analyzer
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/sany.html[SANY]
serves as the front end of TLA2B. SANY was written by Jean-Charles
GrÃ©goire and David Jefferson and is also the front end of the model
checker
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tlc.html[TLC].
After parsing there is type checking phase, in which types of variables
and constants are inferred. So there is no need to especially declare
types in a invariant clause (in the manner of the B method). Moreover it
checks if a TLA+ module is translatable (see Limitations of
Translation).

To tell TLA2B the name of a specification of a TLA+ module you can use a
configuration file, just like for TLC. The configuration file must have
the same name as the name of the module and the filename extension
'cfg'. The configuration file parser is the same as for TLC so you can
look up the syntax in the
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book.html['Specifying
Systems'-book] (Leslie Lamport). If there is no configuration file
available TLA2B looks for a TLA+ definition named 'Spec' or
alternatively for a 'Init' and a 'Next' definition describing the
initial state and the next state relation. Besides that in the
configuration file you can give a constant a value but this is not
mandatory, in contrast to TLC. Otherwise ProB lets you choose during the
animation process a value for the constant which satisfy the assumptions
under the ASSUME clause. TLA2B supports furthermore overriding of a
constant or definition by another definition in the configuration file.

typical structure of a TLA+ module
--------------------------

---- MODULE m ----
EXTENDS m_1, m_2
CONSTANTS c_1, c_2
ASSUME c_1 = ...
VARIABLES v_1, v_2
foo == ...
Init == ...
Next == ...
Spec == ...
=====================
....

Temporal formulas and unused definitions are ignored by TLA2B (they are
also ignored by the type inference algorithm).

[[limitations-of-the-translation]]
Limitations of the translation
------------------------------

* due to the strict type system of the B method there are several
restrictions to TLA+ modules.
** the elements of a set must have the same type (domain and range of a
function are sets)
** TLA+ tuples are translated as sequences in B, hence all components of
the tuple must have the same type
* TLA2B do not support 2nd-order operators, i.e. operators that take a
operator with arguments as argument (e.g.: foo(bar(_),p))

[[tla-actions]]
TLA+ Actions
------------

'''''

TLA2B divides the next state relation into different actions if a
disjunction occurs. IF a existential quantification occurs TLA2B
searches for further actions in the predicate of the quantification and
adds the bounded variables as arguments to these actions. IF a
definition call occurs and the definition has no arguments TLA2B goes
into the definition searching for further actions. The displayed actions
by ProB are not necessarily identical with the actions determined by
TLC.

Corresponding B types to TLA+ data values (let type(e) be the type of
the expression e):

....
TLA+ data                               B Type
--------------------------------------------------
number e.g. 123                         INTEGER
string e.g. "abc"                       STRING
bool value e.g. TRUE                    BOOL
set e.g. {e,f}                          POW(type(e)), type(e) = type(f)
function e.g. [x \in S |-> e]           POW(type(x)*type(e)), type(S) = POW(type(x))
sequence e.g. <<a,b>>                   POW(INTEGER*type(a)), type(a) = type(b)
record e.g. [id_1|->e_1,...,id_n|->e_n] struct(id_1:type(e_1),...,id_n:type(e_n))
model value                             ENUM
 (only definable in config file)

Nat                                     POW(INTEGER)
Int                                     POW(INTEGER)
STRING                                  POW(STRING)
BOOLEAN                                 POW(BOOL)
SUBSET S                                POW(type(S))
....

You can only compare data values with the same type.
