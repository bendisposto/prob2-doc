ProB offers various validation techniques:

* link:/Consistency_Checking[Consistency Checking (Finding Invariant
Violations using the Model Checker)]
* link:/Constraint_Based_Checking[Constraint Based Checking]
* link:/Refinement_Checking[Refinement Checking]
* link:/LTL_Model_Checking[LTL Model Checking]
* link:/Bounded_Model_Checking[Bounded Model Checking]

Here we want to describe the advantages and disadvantages of the various
methods.
