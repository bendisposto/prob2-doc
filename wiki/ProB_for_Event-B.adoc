In addition to classical B (aka B for software development), ProB also
supports Event-B and the Rodin platform. ProB can be installed as a
plugin for Rodin. Once installed, one can
link:/Tutorial_Rodin_Exporting[export contexts and models] as *.eventb
files and use them within ProB Tcl/Tk and the command-line version
link:/Using_the_Command-Line_Version_of_ProB[probcli].

Event-B:
