I found this challenging constraint programming problem in the following
paper:

* B. M. Smith, K. E. Petrie, and I. P. Gent. Models and symmetry
breaking for peaceable armies of queens. In Integration of AI and OR
Techniques in Constraint Programming for Combinatorial Optimization
Problems, pages 271â€“286. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2004.

A variation of the problem can be found on page 329 of the
https://www.elsevier.com/books/handbook-of-constraint-programming/rossi/978-0-444-52726-4[Handbook
on Constraint Programming].

The challenge is to place two equal-sized armies of white and black
queens onto a chessboard. We can distinguish between two problems:

* checking whether two armies of n queens can be placed on a dim*dim
chessboard,
* for a given board of size dim*dim find the maximal size n of armies
that can be placed onto the board, i.e., solving an optimisation
problem.

Here is a B model for the checking problem. The problem is quite
straightforward to encode in B. Many lines below (in the DEFINITIONS)
just define the link:/Graphical_Visualization[animation function to
graphically represent solutions].

Here are some running times on my MacBook Air 1.7 GHz i7, also comparing
to using link:/Using_ProB_with_KODKOD[Kodkod as ProB's backend] and
using an http://alloy.mit.edu/alloy/[Alloy] model (see below).

....
 dim=7, n=7 : solved in 0.3 secs
 dim=7, n=8 : unsat in 20 secs
 dim=8, n=6 : solved in 0.02 secs   (1.12 secs with Kodkod)
 dim=8, n=7 : solved in 0.06 secs   (2.66 secs with Kodkod)
 dim=8, n=8 : solved in 0.53 secs   (8.44 secs with Kodkod; 7.03 secs second run; +/- 8.5 with Alloy & miniSat; 9.3 seconds if we avoid overflows)
 dim=8, n=9 : solved in 12.96 secs  (128.07 secs with Kodkod ; +/- 84 secs with Alloy & miniSat)
 dim=8, n=10 : unsat in 728 secs    (Alloy & miniSat still running after over four hours)
....

The first solution found for dim=8 and n=9 is as follows:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here is the http://alloy.mit.edu/alloy/[Alloy] model we have used.
Initially, the model gave us wrong solutions as we were using `+`
instead of `sum`; this was correct for previous versions of Alloy but
not for Alloy 4.2 which we were using.

[[optimization]]
Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~

One can obviously use the above models to try and manually find a
maximal value of n for a given board size dim. Below, we have encoded
this process as B constraints, by setting up the problem twice: once for
the army size n and a second time for army size n+1. The second encoding
is wrapped into a negated existential quantification. (This model can no
longer be translated into Kodkod because of this.)

ProB solves this optimisation problem in about 780 seconds for a board
size of 8. This is very competitive with the timings reported in the
above mentioned constraint solving paper using new symmetry breaking
techniques and much more low-level encoding on state of the art
constraint solving libraries such as ILOG.
