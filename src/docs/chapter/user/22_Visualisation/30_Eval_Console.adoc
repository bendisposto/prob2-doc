== Eval Console

For this tutorial, load for example the file `StackConstructive.mch`
included in the `examples/Tutorial` directory of the
http://www.stups.uni-duesseldorf.de/ProB/index.php5/Download[ProB
distribution] (this example is also discussed in the
link:/Tutorial_Modeling_Infinite_Datatypes[Tutorial Modeling Infinite
Datatypes]).

After loading the file, double click on the green line
"SETUP_CONSTANTS" in the "Enabled Operations" pane. Now double click
on the green "INITIALISATION" line in the same pane. To start the
"Eval..." interactive console you can either

* use the "Eval..." command in the Analyse menu,
* double-click any line in the "State Properties" pane or
* right-click (Control-Click on a Mac) on the "State Properties" pane
and select the "Eval..." entry as shown below:

This will bring up a new window, the "Eval Console":

You can now enter predicates or expressions and hit return or enter to
evaluate them in the current state of the machine. Below is a small
transcript:

You can use the up and down arrow keys to navigate to earlier predicates
or expressions you have entered.

If you change the state, then the expressions and predicates are
evaluated in that state. For example, if you execute the operations
Push(RANGE3), Push(RANGE1), Push(RANGE2) by double-clicking on the
respective lines in the "Enabled Operations" pane, then a transcript
of using the console is as follows:

The console works the same way for Event-B models, Z and TLA
specifications. However, in all those cases the Eval console uses the
classical B parser and you have to use classical B syntax for entering
predicates or expressions. The console also works in CSP mode and uses a
CSP parser there.

As of version 1.4 the console allows defining new local variables (local
to the console) using Haskell's let syntax: `let id = Expr`. You can
use the `:b` command to browse your let definitions. Here is an example
session:

....
>>> let x = 2**10
 1024
>>> let y = x+x
 2048
>>> :b
  x = 1024
  y = 2048
>>> {v| v>x & v<y & v mod x = 1}
 {1025}
>>>
....

A similar console is also available for the command-line version of ProB
(probcli) using the `-repl` command. More details are
link:/Using_the_Command-Line_Version_of_ProB#-repl[available on the
separate wiki page for probcli.]

We now also have made two versions of a link:/ProB_Logic_Calculator[ProB
Logic Calculator available online]. The second one works similarly to
the Eval console above, but is not linked to any B machine. You can try
it out directly on this page below:
