== Introduction

ProB can generate a wide range of visualizations for your models, e.g.:

* the statespace of a model
* the value of a particular formula
* various reduced representation of the statespace of a model
* one particular state of a model represented as a graph

Firstly, ProB generates a textual representation of a graph in the
"dot" format. This information is typically saved to a file which has
the same name and path as your main model but has a ".dot" extension.
It then uses GraphViz to render this file. For this, it can either make
use of the "dot" program to generate a Postscript file (generating a
file with the ".ps" extension), or it uses a Dot-Viewer (such as
"dotty") to view the file directly.

== Setting up the Graphical Viewer

* GraphViz: in order to make use of the graphical visualization
features, you need to install a version of GraphViz suitable for your
architecture. More details can be found in
<<installation,Installation>>.

* Then use the command "Graphical Viewer Preferences..." in the
_Preferences_ Menu:

Then set or check the following preferences:

* Path/Command for dot program
* Path/Command for dot viewer (e.g., dotty)

Note: you can use the "Pick" button to locate the dot program and the
dot viewer.

In case you want to use the Postscript option, also make sure that you
have a viewer for Postscript files installed, and set the preference
"Path/Command for Postscript viewer".

* You can select which viewer to use by going to the "Graphical
Viewer" sub-menu of the _Preferences_ Menu:
