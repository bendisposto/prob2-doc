= Bounded Model Checking

As of version 1.5, ProB provides support for constraint-based bounded
model checking (BMC). As opposed to
<<constraint-based-checking,constraint-based checking>>, BMC finds
counterexamples which are reachable from the INITIALISATION. As opposed
to <<consistency-checking,ordinary model checking>>, it does not
compute all possible solutions for parameters and constants, but
constructs these on demand. This can be useful when the out-degree of
the state-space is very high, i.e., when there are many possible
solutions for the constants, the initialisation and/or the individual
operations and their parameters.

Take the following example:

....
MACHINE VerySimpleCounterWrong
CONSTANTS lim
PROPERTIES lim = 2**25
VARIABLES ct
INVARIANT
 ct:INTEGER & ct < lim
INITIALISATION ct::0..(lim-1)
OPERATIONS
  Inc(i) = PRE i:1..1000 & ct + i <= lim THEN ct := ct+i END;
  Reset = PRE ct = lim THEN ct := 0 END
END
....

The ProB model checker will here run for a very long time before
uncovering the error that occurs when `ct` is set to lim. If you run the
<<tlc,TLC backend>> you will get the error message
"`Too many possible next states for the last state in the trace.`"

However, for the bounded model checker this is less of a problem; it
will use the constraint solver to try and find suitable values of the
constants, initial variable values and parameters to generate an
invariant violation. The bounded model checker actually uses the same
algorithm than the link:/Test_Case_Generation[constraint-based test-case
generator], but uses the negation of the invariant as target. You can
use the command-line version of ProB, with the
<<using-the-command-line-version-of-prob,`-bmc DEPTH`>>
command as follows:

....
$ probcli VerySimpleCounterWrong -bmc 10

You can also use the bounded model checker from ProB Tcl/Tk. The command
is situated inside the Experimental sub-menu of the Analyse menu (to see
the command, you may have to change the preference entry to
`preference(user_is_an_expert_with_accessto_source_distribution,true).`
in the `ProB_Preferences.pl` file) Running the command on the above
example will generate the following counter-example:
