= Constraint Based Checking

:category: User_Manual


ProB also offers an alternative checking method, inspired by the Alloy
footnote:[D. Jackson: Alloy: A lightweight object modeling notation. ACM
Transactions Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM),
11(2):256â€“290, 2002.] analyser. In this mode of operation, ProB does not
explore the reachable states starting from the initial state(s), but
checks whether applying a single operation can result in a property
violation (invariant and assertion) independently of the particular
initialization of the B machine. This is done by symbolic constraint
solving, and we call this approach constraint based checking (another
sensible name would be model finding).

More details and examples can be found in the
link:/Tutorial_Model_Checking,_Proof_and_CBC[tutorial page on model
checking, proof and CBC].

[[difference-between-constraint-based-checking-and-model-checking]]
Difference between Constraint Based Checking and Model Checking
---------------------------------------------------------------

<<consistency-checking,Model checking>> tries to find a sequence of
operations that, starting from an initial state, leads to a state which
violates a property. Constraint based checking tries to find a state of
the machine that satisfies the property but where we can apply a single
operation to reach a state that violates this property. If the
constraint based checker finds a counter-example, this indicates that
the B specification may contain a problem. The sequence of operations
discovered by the constraint based checker leads from a valid state to a
property violation, meaning that the B machine may have to be corrected.
The valid state is not necessarily reachable from a valid initial state.
This situation further indicates that it will be impossible to prove the
machine using the B proof rules. In other words, the constraint-based
checker verifies that the invariant is inductive.

A comparison between all link:/ProB_Validation_Methods[ProB validation
methods can be found on a separate manual page].

[[commands-of-the-constraint-based-checker]]
Commands of the Constraint Based Checker
----------------------------------------

These commands are only accessible in the "Normal" mode of ProB (see
link:/General_Presentation_(tcl/tk)#The_ProB_main_window[General
Presentation]) and are in the sub-menu "Verify|Constraint Based
Checking". The command "Constraint Search for Invariant Violations"
will execute the constraint based checking described above to check for
invariant violations. The process stops as soon as a counterexample has
been found and then displays the counter-example in the animation panes.
The command "Constraint Search for Invariant Violations..." enables
the user to specify which particular operation leading from the valid
state to the invariant violation of the B specification should be
considered during the constraint based checking.

The "Constraint Search for Assertion Violations" command executes the
constraint based checking looking for assertion violations, while the
command "Constraint Search for Abort Conditions" executes it looking
for abort conditions.

Within the link:/Using_the_Command-Line_Version_of_ProB[command-line
version of ProB], there are also several commands available:

* <<using-the-command-line-version-of-prob,cbc >>
to check whether an operation preserves the invariant
* <<using-the-command-line-version-of-prob,cbc_deadlock>>
to check whether the invariant implies that no deadlock is possible
* <<using-the-command-line-version-of-prob,cbc_assertions>>
to check whether the static assertions (on constants) are implied by the
axioms/properties.

The following command is related to the above:

* link:/Using_the_Command-Line_Version_of_ProB#-cbc_sequence_.3CSEQ.3E[cbc_sequence
] to find a sequence of operations using the constraint solver
