== Tutorial Enabling Analysis

The B-method and in particular its successor Event-B are methodologies
for formal development and verification of systems. In Event-B, a
machine is usually viewed as a reactive system executing continuously
enabled (atomic) events in an interleaved fashion. Thus, parallel events
of the system are easily modeled as an interleaving of operation
executions. On the other hand, the introduction of abstract counters is
required when events are supposed to be executed in some (sequential)
order. This, however, can in some cases slow the work of understanding
and verifying a model since identifying the sequential ordering of
events in an Event-B model is not that obvious. Thus, using methods for
determining the control flow can be sometimes very beneficial for
understanding the model, as well as for techniques for automatic
verification such as model checking.

In this tutorial we present a static analysis for B and Event-B that can
be used to reveal the control flow of a machine and to optimize model
checking of models written in B and Event-B (see also
https://www3.hhu.de/stups/prob/index.php/Tutorial_Various_Optimizations#Partial_Guard_Evaluation[Tutorial
on Partial Guard Evaluation]). The results of the analysis, designated
also as "enabling analysis", can be presented as relations by means of
a table or by means of a graph. For simplicity, we will concentrate
mainly on B and use the terminology of the formalism.

[[enabling-relations]]
=== Enabling Relations

What we want to find out is how the operations influence each other
within a B model. In other words, for each pair (op1, op2) of operations
we try to determine as precise as possible how op1 can affect the guard
condition of op2 with regard to enabledness. To determine the enabling
relations between operations we use syntactic analyses, as well as the
constraint-based abilities of ProB.

Consider the following B machine:

....
MACHINE Example
VARIABLES x, y, z
INVARIANT
    x:NATURAL
  & y:INTEGER
  & z:INTEGER
INITIALISATION
  x:=6 || y:=-2 || z:=0
OPERATIONS
  Op1 = PRE x + y>=4  THEN x:=x+2 || y:=2 END;
  Op2 = PRE x mod 2=1 THEN x:=x+1 || y:=2 END;
  Op3 = PRE x mod 2=0 THEN x:=x+2 END;
  Op4 = PRE x<0 THEN y:=y-1 END;
  Op5 = PRE y/=2 THEN z:=3 END
END
....

The machine has three variables x,y,z, where x ranges over the domain of
natural numbers and y and z over the domain of all integers. For this
machine we have 25 pairs of operations for which we want to determine
the respective enabling relations. Additionally, we identify 5 further
pairs that show the influence of the INITIALISATION on the guard
conditions of all other operations. Consider, for example, the pair
(Op2,Op1) in `Example.mch`. Clearly, Op1 is enabled in each state of
`Example.mch` where the predicate ‘x+y>=4’ is fulfilled. Since the
effect of Op2 assigns 2 to y and increments x by one upon condition that
x is a positive odd number in the before-state of Op2, we can assume
that Op1 is always enabled after the execution of Op2. In other words,
in all after-states of Op2 the operation Op1 is guaranteed to be
enabled. This relation between Op2 and Op1 we can illustrate as follows:

image::GuaranteedRelationEn.png[]

In the figure above the green boxes denote that the evaluation of the
guard of Op1 is true, whereas the red boxes denote that the evaluation
of the guard of Op1 is false.

Another pair of interest is (Op2,Op5) in `Example.mch`. Clearly, Op5 is
enabled only in those states in which y is not equal to 2. Obviously, in
each after-state of Op2 y is equal to 2 and thus we can conclude that
Op5 is impossible to be enabled after each execution of Op2. Such a
relation between two operations we denote as "impossible" and can be
illustrated as follows:

image::ImpossibleRelationEn.png[]

Both arrows in the illustration of the "impossible" relation indicate
that whether the guard condition of Op5 is fulfilled or not in a
before-state of Op2 operation Op5 will be disabled in the respective
after-state of Op2. In order to recognize a tuple (op1,op2) as
"impossible" we require that op2 is always disabled after op1 without
further considering whether op2 is always enabled or always disabled in
the before-states of op1.

Consider, for instance, the pair (Op2, Op2) in the machine above. We can
easily conclude that Op2 becomes disabled after it is executed and
clearly, the second case (\false -> \false) of the impossible relation
is not possible for (Op2, Op2). This gives rise of introducing another
(more precise) impossible relation:

image::ImpossibleDisableRelation.png[]

Accordingly, we can derive another relation from "impossible" for
which only the second case of the "impossible" relation is fulfilled:

image::ImpossibleKeepRelation.png[]

As an example for a pair of operations that fulfills the
"impossible_keep" requirement you can take, for example, the pair
(Op3,Op2) from `Example.mch`. Since Op2 and Op3 cannot be both enabled
in a state and the execution of Op3 cannot enable Op2, then we can
easily conclude that Op2 remains always disabled after Op3.

Similarly as for "impossible", one could derive two further enabling
relations from "guaranteed":

image::GuaranteedEnableKeepRelation.png[]

Another interesting class of enabling relations that could be helpful
for better understanding and analyzing B and Event-B models is that of
the "keep" relations. We say that an operation op1 "keeps" another
operation op2 if op1 cannot change the status of the enabling condition
of op2, i.e. op1 keeps op2 enabled respectively disabled. This
relationship could be illustrated as follows:

image::KeepRelation.png[]

We can take (Op1,Op2) and (Op1,Op3) as examples of pairs in
`Example.mch` that are elements of the keep relation. "keep" relations
can sometimes be easily determined by analyzing just the syntactic
structure of both operations, or more precisely the “read” and “write”
sets of both operations.footnote:[For an operation op the set read(op)
denotes the set of variables that are read by op. Accordingly, by
write(op) we denote the set of variables that are written by op.] If,
for example, an operation op1 does not write any variable of the machine
that is read in the guard condition of op2, then we can infer that op1
"keeps" op2. In that case we also say that op1 does not change op2
syntactically. In the class of the "keep" relations are included also
relations such as independence. Two operations op1 and op2 are called
independent if each of them cannot disable the other operation and the
both orders of execution and have the same effect.footnote:[See the
https://www3.hhu.de/stups/prob/index.php/Tutorial_Various_Optimizations#Partial_Order_Reduction[Tutorial
on Partial Order Reduction] for more information on independence between
operations.]

All three classes ("guaranteed", "impossible" and "keep") of
enabling relations presented so far represent definite relations. That
is, if a pair of operations (op1,op2) is confirmed to be a relation of
one of this three classes, then we can certainly say what effect on the
enabling condition of op2 would the execution of op1 have. However, for
some pairs of operations we cannot certainly say what effect an
operation would have on the enabling condition of another operation.
This is due to the fact that the enabling status of an operation does
not only depend on the effect of the executed operations, but also on
the current variables’ evaluation. Take, for instance, the tuple
(Op3,Op1) from the B machine above. Considering the action part of Op3
and the guard condition of Op1 we can assume that Op3 can enable Op1.
Since the guard of Op1 depends not only on the current value of x, but
also on y, there could be transitions s -> s' of Op3 in the state space
of the machine where Op1 is disabled in both states s and s’. Though,
what we could definitely say is that Op3 cannot disable Op1. This
relationship we can illustrate as follows:

image::PossibleEnableRelation.png[]

The opposite relation of “possible_enable” is the relation where an
operation op2 can disable another operation op1. Formally, we say that
op2 can disable op1 if op2 may disable op1 and op2 cannot enable op1.
This relationship is denoted as “possible_disable” and can be
illustrated as follows:

image::PossibleDisableRelation.png[]

In order to determine how operations influence each other we need to
assure first that these are feasible. An operation "op" is said to be
feasible if there is a state of the machine that satisfies the invariant
of the machine and in which "op" is enabled. In the B machine above
the operation Op4, for example, is not feasible. Obviously, Op4 is
enabled only in states where x is a negative number and states in which
x is a negative number are visibly not consistent with the invariant
since "x : NATURAL". Such incompatibilities are sometimes of great
importance for the modeler and therefore they should be revealed in the
process of computing the enabling relations. In our case for each pair
of operations (Op4,-) and (-,Op4) the status “infeasible” will be
returned.

We can now list all possible enabling relations for the machine
`Example.mch` by means of a table. For each entry in the table the
operation in the row is the operation whose effect is studied on the
status of the guard of the operation in the column.

image::EnablingResults.png[]

Rather than showing the enabling information for each pair of operations
of the machine, one can display the enabling relations by means of a
graph. The graph contains the operations as nodes and the above enabling
relations as edges between the nodes, with the exception that relations
marked as impossible, independent or infeasible are not shown in the
graph. We denote such graphs as enable graphs. The enable graph of
`Example.mch` looks as follows.

image::EnableGraph_Example.png[]

From the enable graph one can recognize the control flow of the model
and deduce some properties. For example, we can clearly see that `Op4`
cannot occur after the execution of another operation.

[[summary-of-the-enabling-relations]]
=== Summary of the Enabling Relations

In the following, we summarize most of the enabling relations that we
think can provide a useful feedback to the user. For each of the
enabling relations we have given an appropriate example. In the examples
below we compute the effect of executing ‘op1’ on the status of the
guard of ‘op2’. The relation identifiers are the same as they appear as
results in ProB.

* _guaranteed_: op2 guaranteed to be executable after op1.

image::GuaranteedExample.png[]

* _guaranteed_enable_: op2 is guaranteed to become enabled after op1.

image::GuaranteedEnableExample.png[]

* _guaranteed_keep_: op2 is guaranteed to stay enabled after op1.

image::ImpossibleDisableExample.png[]

* _impossible_keep_: op2 is impossible to become enabled after op1.

image::ImpossibleKeepExample.png[]

* _keep_: op2 always stays enabled resp. disabled after op1.

image::KeepExample.png[]

guard of op2, i.e. write(op1) /\ read(op2) = \{}

image::SyntacticUnchangedExample.png[]

* _syntactic_independent_: op1 and op2 are syntactically independent,
i.e. read(op1) /\ write(op2) = \{} & write(op1) /\ read(op2) = \{} &
write(op1) /\ write(op2) = \{}

image::SyntacticIndependentExample.png[]

* _syntactically_fully_independent_: op1 and op2 are syntactically
independent and additionally, read(op1) /\ read(op2) = \{}

image::SyntacticFullyIndependentExample.png[]

* _possible_enable_: op2 possible after op1, but op2 cannot be disabled
by op1.

image::PossibleEnableExample.png[]

* _possible_disable_: op2 possible after op1, but op2 cannot be enabled
by op1.

image::PossibleDisableExample.png[]

* _infeasible_: op1 is not feasible and thus cannot influence op2.

image::InfeasibleExample.png[]

[[performing-enabling-analysis-within-prob]]
=== Performing Enabling Analysis within ProB

The enabling analysis has been implemented in the ProB toolset. The
computation of the enabling relations is based on syntactic and
constraint-based techniques. The identification of relations such as
"syntactic_independent" and "syntactic_unchanged" requires just a
thorough study of the syntactic structure of the operations, i.e. no
calls to the constraint solver have to be made. However, to confirm, for
example, that an operation is guaranteed or impossible to be executed
after another operation the use of the ProB’s constraint solver is
unavoidable. For instance, consider the pair (Op2,Op1) from
`Example.mch`. As we have seen, in `Example.mch` the operation Op1 is
guaranteed to be enabled after each execution of Op2. In ProB this could
be computed by feeding the (before-after) predicate “ (x mod 2 = 1) &
(x'=x+1 & y=2) & (x'+y'<4)” into the constraint solver. As a result, the
constraint solver will not find a solution for the predicate, i.e. the
constraint solver will not find a state "s" satisfying “x mod 2 = 1”
from which after executing Op2 at "s" a solution state s’ will be
found that fulfills “x+y<4”; note that “x+y<4” is the negation of the
guard of Op1. Since there is no after-state of Op2 at which Op1 is
disabled we can conclude that Op1 is guaranteed to be executed after
Op2. When constraints are getting more complex the constraint solver may
need more time for solving. Thus, the computation of the enabling
relations may become a very time-expensive task. Therefore, a time-out
for each constraint solver call is set. In other words, if the
constraint solver does not find a solution in the given time by the
user, then the respective relation will be denoted as time-outed. By
default, in ProB the time-out for each constraint solver call is set to
300 ms.

Within `ProB Tcl/Tk` you can find the menu "Enabling Analysis" in the
"Analysis" menu of the menu bar.

image::EnablingAnalysisMenu.png[]

The "Enabling Analysis" menu provides multiple commands:

* "Enabling Analysis (Table)": this command performs a (fast) enabling
analysis on the respective B model using a time-out of 300 ms for the
constraint-solver calls. The result of the enabling analysis is shown in
a table. The table lists all enabling relations between the operations
of the loaded B model. These can be exported to a CSV file. The table
for `Example.mch` at the end of the _' Enabling Relations_' section was
constructed this way.
* "Enabling Analysis (Precise, Table)": this command performs an
enabling analysis using a time-out of 2800 ms for each of the
constraint-solver calls. As for the command above, the result of the
analysis is shown in a table that can be exported to a CSV file.
* "Enabling Relations After...": this command computes all the
enabling relations involving an operation chosen by the user.
* "Enabling Analysis (Graph)": this command performs the fast enabling
analysis but displays the results as a graph. In case the preference
"DOT_SHOW_OP_READ_WRITES" is set for each operation the read/write
information is displayed.
* "Enabling Analysis (POR)...": this menu provides further commands
for another form of enabling analysis the results of which are used for
the partial guard evaluation optimisation in ProB.
* "Read/Write Matrix (Table)": this command performs syntactic
analysis on the model. The analysis determines the read and write sets
for each operation of the machine.
* "Dependence Analysis (Table)": this command performs a dependency
analysis for each pair of operations. More specifically, the analysis
determines which operations are dependent or independent to each other.

With the command line version of ProB (probcli) one can perform an
enabling analysis on a B or Event-B model by means of the
`-enabling_analysis` option. The results of the analysis, as well as
intermediate data and some statistics are printed out on the console:

To perform enabling analysis from the command line and save the results
into a CSV-file use the following commando:

....
$ probcli file.mch -enabling_analysis_csv FILE
....

where FILE is the name of the CSV-file in which the results of the
analysis are stored.

Related to this command is the feasibility analysis, which just checks
whether a single event is in principle possible (given the invariant):

....
$ probcli file.mch -feasibility_analysis_csv FILE
....
