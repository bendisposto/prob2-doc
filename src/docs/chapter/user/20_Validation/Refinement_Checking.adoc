ProB can be used for refinement checking
of B, Z and CSP specifications. Below we first discuss refinement
checking for B machines. There is a tutorial on checking CSP assertions
in ProB which can be viewed
http://stups.hhu.de/ProB/w/Checking_CSP_Assertions[here].

[[what-kind-of-refinement-is-checked]]
What kind of refinement is checked?
-----------------------------------

ProB checks trace refinement. In other words, it checks whether every
trace (consisting of executed operations with their parameter values and
return values) of a refinement machine can also be performed by the
abstract specification.

Hence, ProB does *not* check the gluing invariant. Also, PRE-conditions
are treated as SELECT and PRE-conditions of the abstract machine are
*not* always propagated down to the refinement machine. Hence,
refinement checking has to be used with care for classical B machines,
but it is well suited for EventB-style machines.

[[how-does-it-work]]
How does it work?
-----------------

1.  Open the abstract specification, explore its state space (e.g.,using
an exhaustive temporal model check).
2.  Use the command "Save state for later refinement check" in the _Verify_ menu.
3.  Open the refinement machine.
4.  You can now use the "Refinement Check..." command in the _Verify_ menu.
