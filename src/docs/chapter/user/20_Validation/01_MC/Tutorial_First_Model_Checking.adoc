= Tutorial First Model Checking

:category: User_Manual


We assume that you have loaded the "Lift.mch" B machine from the ProB
Examples folder as outlined in link:/Tutorial_First_Step[Tutorial First
Step]. There we have also seen how to execute operations on a B machine
by double clicking on the items in the "Enabled Operations" pane.

[[simple-model-checking]]
== Simple Model Checking

The model checker can be used to systematically execute the operations
and tries to find an erroneous state (e.g., where the invariant is
violated). Select the "Model Check..." command in the _Verify_ menu:

image::ProBWinModelCheckCommand.png[]

This brings up the following dialog box:

image::ProBWinModelCheckDialog.png[]

Now click the "Model Check" button. After a short while, ProB will give you the
following error message:

image::ProBWinModelCheckCounterExampleFound.png[]

The lower half of the ProB window should now look as follows:

The red "**KO**" button in the "State Properties" pane tells us that
the model checker has moved us into a state where the invariant is
violated. Indeed, the `floor` variable has taken up a negative value,
while the invariant requires floor to be between 0 and 99. The
"History" pane tells us the sequence of operations that has led to
this error. (Note that this sequence is not necessarily the shortest
sequence that leads to an error or to this error. However, by selecting
"Breadth First" in the model check dialog above, one can ensure that
the shortest paths are found.)

[[coverage-statistics]]
== Coverage Statistics

We can obtain some statistics about how many states ProB has explored by
selecting the "Compute Coverage" command in the _Analyse_ menu:

image::ProB_LiftAfterModelCheck_Coverage.png[]

In the NODES section we can see that ProB has explored a total of 11
nodes (i.e., states of the B machine). None of these nodes are
deadlocked, in the sense that no operations are applicable. We can also
see that for one node the invariant is violated. Of these 11 nodes, 2
are *open*, meaning that they have not been explored in the sense that:

* the invariant has not been evaluated
* the enabled operations have not been computed.

As such, an open node may contain an invariant violation and/or could be
a deadlocking node. A live node is a node which is not deadlocked and
not open.

We can also see that there are in total 17 transitions among these 11
nodes. A transition is either an operation or an initialization (there
can be one more transition, which we will examine later in the
tutorial).

In the COVERED_OPERATIONS section, we can see more details about these
transitions: we have one initialization, 8 `inc` operations and 8 `dec`
operations.

[[view-statespace]]
== View Statespace

We can obtain a graphical visualization of the state space explored by
ProB. For this, be sure that you have correctly
link:/Graphical_Viewer[installed and setup the graphical viewer as
desribed in the user manual]. Now, choose the "View Statespace"
command in the _Animate_ menu:

image::ProB_LiftAfterModelCheck_Statespace.png[]

We can now see the 11 nodes. The two open nodes are marked in red. You
can also see that there is a virtual root node (the inverted triangle at
the top), representing the "state" of the machine before
initialization. The current node is depicted by the blue hexagon in the
right hand corner.

Note: you can influence the coloring and shapes used by ProB, by
selecting "Graphical Viewer Preferences..." in the _Preferences_
menu.

You can obtain more information about the state space visualization in
the user manual: link:/State_Space_Visualization[State Space
Visualization].
