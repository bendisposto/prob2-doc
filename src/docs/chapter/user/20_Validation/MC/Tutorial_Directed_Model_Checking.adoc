== Tutorial Directed Model Checking

We assume that you have completed
<<tutorial-first-model-checking,Tutorial First Model Checking>> and
<<tutorial-complete-model-checking,Complete model checking>>.

Here we will look a bit closer at the search strategy options of the
ProB model checker. You can set the mode using the `-mc_mode`
command-line switch of
<<using-the-command-line-version-of-prob,probcli>>. In the Tcl/Tk
version you can select the strategy in the model checking dialog box
(which you obtain via the"Model Check..." command in the _Verify_ menu):

The following values are possible in all versions of ProB:

* Mixed DF/BF (`mixed` for `mc_mode`) : mixed depth-first /
breadth-first traversal with random choice; currently the default),
* Breadth First (`bf` for `mc_mode`): breadth-first traversal,
* Depth First (`df`) depth-first traversal,

As of version 1.5.1, the following options are also available:

* Heuristic Function / Random (`heuristic` for `mc_mode`) : try and use
`HEURISTIC_FUNCTION` provided by user in `DEFINITIONS` clause; states
with the smallest value for the heuristic function are treated first by
the model checker. Some explanations can be found
link:/Blocks_World_(Directed_Model_Checking)[in an example about
directed model checking].
* Random (`random`) : choosing next node to process completely at
random,
* Hash-Random (`hash`) :similar to random, but uses the Prolog hash
function of a node instead of a random number generator,
* Out-Degree for Deadlock Checking (`out_degree_hash`): prioritise nodes
with fewer outgoing transitions; mainly useful for deadlock checking.

Note that for exhaustive model checking, where you have to look at the
entire state space and no error state is found, the search strategy has
little nor no influence: it does not really matter in which order we
process the states, when we have to examine all of them anyway. In this
case, the depth-first search is probably the most adequate choice: its
memory requirement is smaller. However, when you expect an error (or
goal state) to be found and when the state space is very large (or even
infinite), then the search strategy can make a big difference: the
difference between finding an error state very quickly, or only after a
very long time or possibly never at all.

To illustrate the effect of the search strategy we use the following
simple example:

....
MACHINE phonebook7
SETS
  Name; Code = {c1,c2,c3,c4}
VARIABLES db, active, activec
DEFINITIONS
  scope_Name == 1..4
INVARIANT
  db : Name +-> Code & active:POW(Name) & activec:POW(Code) &
  dom(db) = active & ran(db) = activec
ASSERTIONS
  card(active) >= card(activec)
INITIALISATION
  db := {} || active := {} || activec := {}
OPERATIONS
dd <-- getdom = dd:= dom(db);
cc <-- lookup(nn) =
  PRE
      nn : Name & nn : active
  THEN
      cc := db(nn)
  END;
add(nn,cc) =
  PRE
      nn:Name & cc:Code  & nn /: active
  THEN
      db := db \/ {nn |-> cc} || active := active \/ {nn} || activec := activec \/ {cc}
  END;
delete(nn,cc) =
  PRE
      nn:Name & cc:Code & nn: active & cc: activec & db(nn) = cc
  THEN
      db := db - {nn |-> cc} || active := active - {nn} || activec := db[(active - {nn})]
  END
END
....

We will illustrate the state space that ProB generates using the various
search strategies when limiting the search to 10 nodes. For this we use
the command-line version as follows (as there we can provide exactly how
many states should be explored):

`$ probcli phonebook7.mch -p MAX_OPERATIONS 99 -mc 10 -spdot out.dot -p DOT_LEAVES FALSE -mc_mode`

However, you can also obtain a similar effect with the Tcl/Tk version by
starting the model checker and then quickly pressing the Cancel button
and then inspecting the state space (Statespace command in the _Visualize_ menu; see
<<tutorial-first-model-checking,Tutorial_First_Model_Checking>>).
Below we show the output of the above command for the various choices of
.

[[breadth-first]]
=== Breadth-First

`$ probcli phonebook7.mch -p MAX_OPERATIONS 99 -mc 10 -spdot out.dot -p DOT_LEAVES FALSE -mc_mode bf`

image::ProB_Phonebook7_spdot_bf.png[]

This mode has the advantage of finding shortest counter examples first.
We also have a guarantee that, provided a counter example exists, a
counter example will sooner or later be found. However, the memory
requirements can be very large and it can take very long to find long
counter examples.

[[depth-first]]
=== Depth-First

`$ probcli phonebook7.mch -p MAX_OPERATIONS 99 -mc 10 -spdot out.dot -p DOT_LEAVES FALSE -mc_mode df`

image::ProB_Phonebook7_spdot_df.png[]

The depth-first traversal has the advantage of lower memory requirements
(concerning storing the unprocessed nodes) and can find very deep
counter examples. While it is typically the best choice for exhaustive
model checking, it can be a poor choice for models with errors. Indeed,
if the state space is infinite, then depth-first may progress infinitely
in one direction, and never find existing counter examples. Also, when
depth-first search finds a counter example, it is typically very long
and possibly hard to understand for the user. The next search strategy,
tries to combine the advantages of breadth-first and depth-first search.

[[mixed-dfbf]]
=== Mixed DF/BF

The mixed search strategy, tries to combine the advantages of
breadth-first and depth-first search. It is the default setting for
ProB. It has the advantage of ensuring the exploration of some branches
in depth, to find errors which require long counter examples (e.g.,
starvation, resource exhaustion kind of bugs). But it also ensures that
we examine the specification more systematically in breadth, and is thus
also good at finding counter examples which require exhaustively to test
all operations (e.g., many errors simply require a particular faulty B
operation to be executed).

`$ probcli phonebook7.mch -p MAX_OPERATIONS 200 -mc 10 -spdot out.dot -p DOT_LEAVES FALSE -mc_mode mixed`

The result will vary from one run of ProB to another:

image::ProB_Phonebook7_spdot_mixed1.png[]

image::ProB_Phonebook7_spdot_mixed2.png[]

It is interesting to compare this result with the random search
strategy, which we show next.

[[random]]
=== Random

`$ probcli phonebook7.mch -p MAX_OPERATIONS 99 -mc 10 -spdot out.dot -p DOT_LEAVES FALSE -mc_mode random`

Here are two sample results:

image::ProB_Phonebook7_spdot_random1.png[]

image::ProB_Phonebook7_spdot_random2.png[]

Compared to the `mixed` option one can notice that the mixed option has
more of a tendency to explore certain branches in depth.

[[hash]]
=== Hash

`$ probcli phonebook7.mch -p MAX_OPERATIONS 99 -mc 10 -spdot out.dot -p DOT_LEAVES FALSE -mc_mode hash`

image::ProB_Phonebook7_spdot_hash.png[]

The difference with the `random` option is that this will always return
the same result, as the hash value of the states do not change from one
run of ProB to another.

[[out-degree]]
=== Out-Degree

`$ probcli phonebook7.mch -p MAX_OPERATIONS 99 -mc 10 -spdot out.dot -p DOT_LEAVES FALSE -mc_mode dlk`

image::ProB_Phonebook7_spdot_dlk.png[]

One can notice that ProB here has a tendency to go into depth, as the
number of enabled operations decreases: if we add a name to the
phonebook, four enabled operations disappear and only two appear (lookup
and delete). Note: here it is important to set the `MAX_OPERATIONS` high
enough, otherwise the resulting state space could be different.
