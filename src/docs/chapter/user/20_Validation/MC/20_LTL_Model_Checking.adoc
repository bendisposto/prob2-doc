= LTL Model Checking

ProB provides
support for LTL (linear temporal logic) model checking. For an
introduction to LTL see the
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_temporal_logic[Wikipedia Article].

To use this feature, select "Check LTL/CTL Assertions" in the
_Verify_ menu. The feature can also be accessed by the key combination
"Ctrl+L" under Windows and Linux, and by the key combination "Cmd+L"
under MacOS. The following window appears:

image::Ltlviewer.png[]

All LTL formulas that are given in the "DEFINTIONS" section of a B
machine are displayed in the list box of the LTL/CTL Assertions Viewer.
For CSP-M specifications all LTL formulas given in the LTL pragmas of
the loaded CSP-M file will be shown in the viewer. (For more detailed
information of how LTL/CTL assertions can be stored into B and CSP-M
models see Section *Storing LTL Assertions into a Model*).

A new LTL formula can be entered in the entry below the list box. (We
explain the supported syntax below). The typed formula can then be
either added to the list box by clicking the "Add" button or directly
checked by clicking the "Check" button. Before doing that assure
whether you are in the proper frame ("Add LTL Formula") of the bottom
part of the LTL viewer.

The LTL model checker can be started for an LTL formula by performing a
double-click on the respective formula or typing "Enter" after
selecting the respective formula. Each LTL formula in the list box has
on the left hand side a symbol that indicates what is the status of the
respective formula. An LTL formula can have one of the following
statuses (status symbols may differ under different operating systems):

* ? – The formula has not been checked yet.
* ✔ – The formula is true for all valid paths.
* ✘ – A counterexample for the formula has been found, i.e. there is a
path that violates the formula. In case the formula has been just
checked on the model the animator is navigated to the last state of the
counterexample. The full path can then be seen in the history. The
counterexample can be also obtained by the dotty-viewer after a second
double-click on the formula in the assertions’ viewer.
* ⌚ – The formula is currently checked.
* ! – The formula check has been aborted by an unexpected error
occurrence.
* ∞ – The formula check is incomplete, i.e. no counterexample was found
so far, but the absence of a path that does not satisfy the formula can
not be guaranteed because the state space was not fully explored. A new
check can be started by a double-click.

All formulas can be checked by "Assertions -> Check All Assertions" in
the menu bar. All formulas will be then checked from top to bottom in
the list box.

Additionally, the viewer provides a context menu for the list box
elements. The context menu can be popped-up by a right-mouse-click on a
formula from the list box, and it performs a set of actions available to
be performed on the currently selected formula (see Figure below).

The old LTL and CTL dialogs can be accessed from "OldLtlViewers" in
the menu bar.

[[ltl-preferences]]
== LTL Preferences

There is a set of options coming with the LTL model checker. In this
section we give a brief overview of the preferences. The LTL preferences
can be viewed by selecting "LTL Preferences" in the _Preferences_
menu of the LTL/CTL Assertions Viewer.

*Exploring new states* +
The LTL model checker searches in the already explored search space of
the model. If a state is encountered that has not been explored before,
the state will be explored (i.e. all transitions to successor states are
computed). The number of how often this can happen is limited by the
field "Max no. of new states". Depending on the LTL formula, a
partially explored state space can be sufficient to find a
counterexample or to assure the absence of a counterexample. If there's
still the possibility of a counterexample in the remaining unexplored
state space, the user will get a message.

*Optimizing the process of LTL model checking* +
The process of model checking can be optimized for B and Event-B models
by using partial order reduction. The idea of partial order reduction is
to execute only a subset of all enabled actions in each state. Thus,
only a part of the original state space is checked for the checked
property. The reduction of the state space depends on the number of
concurrent and independent actions in the model, as well as on the
property being checked.

*With Safety Check* +
This checks whether a formula is a safety property or not. If it is,
this property is treated in an optimised way. In some cases, this means
that not the entire state space has to be computed. For this
optimisation to work, ProB needs the LTL2BA translator. You can download
and put it into ProB's lib folder, by choosing

`Download and Install LTL2BA Tool...`

from the _Help_ menu.

*Search Options* +
The model checker searches for a counterexample (i.e. a path that does
not satisfy the current formula). Where the checked paths through the
model's search space start depend on the following options in the "LTL
Preferences"’ menu:

1.  _Start search in initialization_ +
All paths that start in a state of the initialization of the machine are
checked.
2.  _Start search in current state_ +
All paths that start in the current state are checked.
3.  _Start in initialization, but check formula in current state_ +
All paths that start in a state of the initialization of the machine are
checked, but the formula is mapped to the current state. For example,
this option can be used to check properties like "Is this state only
reachable directly after executing operation `xy`?": The formula would
be `Y[xy]`. This is equivalent to "G (current => f)" with f as the
entered formula and using the option "Start search in initialization".

Note: Whereas `Y true` is always false when checked with option 1 or 2,
it is usually true (but not in all cases) for option 3.

[[supported-syntax]]
=== Supported Syntax

ProB supports LTL^[e]^, an extended version of LTL. In contrast to the
standard LTL, LTL^[e]^ provides also support for propositions on
transitions, not only on states. In practice, writing propositions on
transitions is allowed by using the constructs `e(...)` and `[...]`.
(see below). The LTL model checker of ProB supports Past-LTL^[e]^ as
well.

* Atomic propositions can be one of the following:
** Predicates can be written in curly braces: `\{...}`. E.g.
`\{card(someset) > 1}`
** To check if an operation is enabled in a state use `e(Op)`, where
`Op` is the name of the operation.
** To start a search from the current state of the animation use
`current` (see the section *LTL Preferences* for more information).
** To check if a state has no outgoing transition leading to a different
state use `sink`. This can be useful for finding "pseudo"-deadlocks,
i.e. states where only query-operations are enabled that do not change
the state. Note that `sink` holds for deadlock states as well.
** For checking if a state is a deadlock state the atomic proposition `deadlock` can be used.
** To check if a set of operations is disabled in a state use
`deadlock(Op1,Op2,...,Opk)`, where Op1,Op2,...,Opk with k>0 are
operations of the model. It is also possible to check if specific
representations of an operation with arguments are disabled in a state
using pattern-matching, e.g.: `deadlock(Op(1),Op(3))`.
** By means of `deterministic(Op1,Op2,...,Opk)`, where Op1,Op2,...,Opk
with k>0 are operations of the model, one can check if maximum one of
the operations Op1,Op2,...,Opk is enabled in a state.
** To check if exactly one operation from a set of operations
Op1,Op2,...,Opk is enabled in a state use `controller(Op1,Op2,…,Opk)`.

* Transition propositions: +
If the next executed operation in the path is `Op`, the expression
`[Op]` can be used. Also patter-matching for the arguments of the
operation is supported. E.g. `[Op(3,4*v)]` checks if the next operation
is `Op` and that the first argument is 3 and the third argument is `4*v`
where `v` is a variable of the machine. +
Arbitrary B expressions can be used as patterns. Constants and variables
of the machine can be used. Variables have the values of the state where
the operations starts.

* Logical operators
** `true` and `false`
** `not`: negation
** `&`, `or` and `=>`: conjunction, disjunction and implication

* Temporal operators (future)
** `G f`: globally
** `F f`: finally
** `X f`: next
** `f U g`: until
** `f W g`: weak until
** `f R g`: release

* Temporal operators (past)
** `H f`: history (dual to G)
** `O f`: once (dual to F)
** `Y f`: yesterday (dual to X)
** `f S g`: since (dual to until)
** `f T g`: trigger (dual to release)

* Fairness operators
** `WF(Op)` or `wf(Op)`: weak fairness, where `Op` is an operation
** `SF(Op)` or `sf(Op)`: strong fairness, where `Op` is an operation
** `WEF`: weak fairness for all possible operations
** `SEF`: strong fairness for all possible operations

[[setting-fairness-constraints]]
== Setting Fairness Constraints

Fairness is a notion where the search for counterexamples is restricted
to paths that do not ignore infinitely the execution of a set of enabled
operations imposed by the user as "fair" constraints. One possibility
to set fairness constraints in ProB is to encode them in the LTL^[e]^
formula intended to be checked. For example, for a given LTL^[e]^
formula "f" a set of weak fairness conditions \{a1,…,an} can be given
as follows:

`(FG e(a1) => GF [a1]) & … & (FG e(an) => GF [an]) => f.`

In a similar way, strong fairness constraints can be imposed expressed
by means of an LTL^[e]^ formula:

`(GF e(a1) => GF [a1]) & … & (GF e(an) => GF [an]) => f.`

Checking fairness in this way is very often considered to be inefficient
as usually the number of atoms (the possible valuations of the property)
of the LTL property is exponential in the size of the
formula.footnote:[O. Lichtenstein and A. Pnueli: _Checking that Finite
State Concurrent Programs Satisfy Their Linear Specification_. POPL '85,
Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGACT-SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of
Programming Languages, ACM, 1985] For this reason, the search algorithm
of the LTL model checker has been extended in order to allow fairness to
be checked efficiently. In addition, new operators have been added to
the ProB’s LTL parser for setting fairness constraints to an LTL^[e]^
property. The new operators are _WF(-)_ and _SF(-)_ and both accept as
argument an operation. The fairness constraints must be given by means
of implication: "fair => f", where "f" is the property to be checked
and "fair" the fairness constraints.

In particular, "fair" can have one of the forms: "wfair", "sfair",
"wfair & sfair", and "sfair & wfair", where "wfair" and "sfair"
represent the imposed weak and strong fairness constraints,
respectively.

Basically, "wfair" and "sfair" are expressed by means of logical
formulas having the following syntax:

* Weak fair conditions ("wfair"):
** `WF(a)`, where `a` is an operation
** `&` and `or`: conjunction and disjunction

* Strong fair conditions ("sfair"):
** `SF(a)`, where `a` is an operation
** `&` and `or`: conjunction and disjunction

For instance, if we want to check an LTL property "f" on paths that
are weak fair in regard to the operations "a" and "b" and
additionally strong fair in regard to "c" or "d", then this can be
given as follows:

`(WF(a) & WF(b)) & (SF(c) or SF(d)) => f`

Note that the operators _WF(-)_ and _SF(-)_ cannot appear on the right
side of the fairness implication. Basically, _WF(-)_ and _SF(-)_ can be
described by the following equivalences:

`WF(a) ≡ (FG e(a) => GF [a]) and SF(a) ≡ (GF e(a) => GF [a]), where a is an operation.`

For setting fairness constraints on all possible operations of the model
being checked use the operators "WEF" and "SEF". For instance, if
"f" is a liveness property and we want to restrict the search only to
strongly fair paths, then we can impose the fairness constraints by
means of the formula "SEF => f".

The grammar for imposing fairness constraints by means of the fairness
implication ("fair => f") looks as follows:

----
fair ::= WEF | SEF | wfair | sfair | wfair & sfair | sfair & wfair
wfair ::= wf(a) | ( wfair ) | wfair & wfair | wfair or wfair
sfair ::= sf(a) | ( sfair ) | sfair & sfair | sfair or sfair
----

where "a" is a transition proposition.

[[storing-ltl-assertions-in-the-model]]
== Storing LTL Assertions in the Model

*Storing LTL formulas in B machines* +
LTL formulas can be stored in the DEFINITIONS section of a B machine.
The name of the definition must start with ASSERT_LTL and a string
must be specified. In case there is more than one LTL assertion given in
the DEFINITIONS section, the particular LTL assertions must be
separated by semicolon. For example:

----
DEFINITIONS
ASSERT_LTL  == "G (e(SetCruiseSpeed) => e(CruiseBecomesNotAllowed))";
ASSERT_LTL1 == "G (e(CruiseBecomesNotAllowed) => e(SetCruiseSpeed))";
ASSERT_LTL2 == "G (e(CruiseBecomesNotAllowed) => (ObstacleDisappears))"
----

*Storing LTL formulas in CSP-M specifications* +
LTL formulas can be stored within pragmas in CSP-M specifications. A
pragma in which a single LTL formula is stored is given by "{-#
assert_ltl "f" "c" #-}", where "assert_ltl" indicates the type of
the information stored in the pragma (there are currently two types:
assert_ltl and assert_ctl), and is followed by the LTL formula `f` and a
comment `c` (the comment is optional). Both, the LTL formula and the
comment, must be enclosed in double quotes. It is also possible to give
several LTL formulas in a single pragma within which the corresponding
LTL assertions are separated by semicolon. For example:

----
{-# assert_ltl "SF(enter.1) & WF(req.1) => GF([enter.1])";
    assert_ltl "SF(enter.2) & WF(req.2) => GF([enter.2])";
    assert_ltl "GF [enter.1] & GF [enter.2]" "Should fail."#-}
----

Note that a semicolon must not follow the last assertion in a pragma.

For CSP-M specifications, it is also possible to assert LTL-formulae to
particular processes in the model. This is possible by means of
`assert` declarations, which have been recently included to the CSP-M
grammar of the ProB CSP-M parser:

`assert P |= LTL: "ltl-formula"`

where `P` is an arbitrary process and `ltl-formula` an LTL formula.


[[ltl-formulas-in-a-separate-file]]
== LTL Formulas in a Separate File

With the command line version of ProB it is possible to check several
LTL^[e]^ formulae with one call. The command has the following syntax:

`probcli -ltlfile FILE ...`

The file FILE contains one or more sections where each section has the
form:

`[Name]  Formula`

The formula itself can spread several lines. Additional comments can be
added with a leading #. If a counter-example is found, the trace of the
counter-example is saved into the file ltlce_Name.trace, where "Name"
is the name of the formula in the LTL file.

One also can check a single LTL^[e]^ formula _F_ using the option
'-ltlformula' as follows:

`probcli -ltlformula "F"...`

[[ltl-formulae-in-a-separate-file]]

`probcli -ltlformula "F"...`

[[ltl-model-checker-output]]
== LTL Model Checker Output

The output provided by the LTL model checker can sometimes reveal some
interesting statistical facts about the model and the property being
checked on the model. The LTL model checker of ProB uses the tableau
approach for checking an LTL^[e]^ formula on a formal model. To check
whether a model _M_ satisfies a given formula _f_, the algorithm
generates a search graph, called also tableau graph, composed from the
tableau of the formula and the state space of the model. If there is a
path in the search graph that is a model for _f_, then the formula is
satisfiable. The nodes of the search graph are called _atoms_.

Basically, using the tableau approach we prove that _M_ satisfies _f_ by
negating the given formula and searching for a path fulfilling _¬f_. If
such a path is found, then we infer that _M_ violates _f_. Otherwise, if
no path is found that satisfies _¬f_, we conclude that _M |= f_. The LTL
model checking algorithm of ProB is based on searching for strongly
connected components (SCCs) with certain properties to determine whether
_M_ satisfies _f_. Finding such an SCC that can be reached from an
initial state of _M_ is a witness for a counter-example for _f_.
Sometimes, we use fairness to ignore such SCCs that do not fulfill the
imposed fairness constraints in order to not impede proving a property
by returning of non-fair paths as counter-examples.

The LTL model checker algorithm of ProB is implemented in C using a
callback mechanism for evaluating the atomic propositions and the
outgoing transitions in SICStus Prolog. (For each state of the model a
callback will be performed.) Additionally, the search for SCCs is based
on the Tarjan's algorithm. In the terminal all messages coming from the
LTL model checker are preceded either by "LTL (current statistics): " or
"LTL model checking:". The output from the LTL model checker can give
helpful insights about the model and the model checking process.

Consider the CSP specifications "dphil_ltl8.csp" representing a model
of the dining philosophers problem for eight philosophers which resolves
the starvation problem by always forcing the first philosopher to pick
up first the right fork instead of the left one. In other words,
"dphil_ltl8.csp" has no deadlock states. Checking the LTL formula "GF
[eat.0]" from the command line will produce the following output:

----
$ probcli -ltlformula "GF [eat.0]" dphil_ltl8.csp
....
LTL model checking formula
% parsing_ltl_formula
% initialising_ltlc
starting_model_checking

LTL (current statistics): 13280 atoms, 10070 transitions generated, and  2631 callbacks needed.

LTL model checking: found counter-example (lasso-form): intro length = 1126, path in SCC of length = 5
LTL model checking: memory usage approx. 1924 KiB, 14104 atoms and 10724 transitions generated

! source(ltl)

Formula FALSE.

Runtime: 22220 ms
! *** error occurred ***
! ltl
----

As one can clearly see from the output, the LTL model checker fails to
prove "GF [eat.0]" on the model since it has found a counter-example
for the formula. Note that the ProB LTL model checker explores the
search graph and the state space dynamically. The above data is to be
understand as follows:

* 14104 atoms - the LTL model checker needed to explore 14104 atoms to
find a counter-example for the formula.
* 2803 callbacks needed - to explore the search graph the model checker
makes callbacks in order to explore the state space of the model being
checked (the exploration runs dynamically) and compute the successor
states in the tableau graph. In this case the model checker has needed
to explore 2803 states till it finds a counter-example for the formula
* memory usage approx. 1924 KiB - the memory needed to explore the
tableau graph
* found counter-example (lasso-form) - means that the counter-example
being found is path beginning in an initial state of the model and
reaching a state that closes a cycle:
** intro length = 1126: the length of the sub-path from an initial state
to the entry point of the cycle
** path in SCC of length = 5: the cycle is comprised of five states
* total time 22492ms - the LTL model checker needed about 23 seconds to
find the counter-example. Here a distinction between the time needed to
explore the state space of the model (2803 callbacks needed 22465ms) and
the time spent for generating the tableau graph + the time for
identifying the self-fulfilling SCC (netto 26ms)
* LTL (current statistics) - an intermediate data information is given
each 20 seconds spent from the last current data information.

In the example above one can prove the LTL^[e]^ formula "GF [eat.0]"
on "dphil_ltl6.csp" using fairness. One can impose, for example, strong
fairness conditions on all transitions of the model and thus verify that
"GF [eat.0]" is satisfied under strong fairness. The call looks as
follows:

----
$ probcli -ltlformula "SEF => GF [eat.0]" dphil_ltl8.csp
...

LTL Formula TRUE.
No counter example found for SEF => GF [eat.0].
Runtime: 188370 ms
----

In the above check no fair counter-example could be found for the
formula "GF [eat.0]". For this check the search graph comprises 96500
atoms and 381625 transitions, far more than the previous formula check
(without fairness assumptions). Since no fair counter-example was found
we can infer that the whole state space of the model was explored.
Further, since we know from above that 22363 callbacks were needed to
explore the search graph, we can infer that the state space of the model
has in total 22363 states.

In the output above there is also some information about the fairness
checking being performed for the model checker run. Form the fairness
statistics we can see that the model checker has refuted 800 SCCs in
total, i.e. there were 800 SCCs in the search graph that could serve as
a counter-example for "GF [eat.0]" in case no fairness constraints
were imposed.
