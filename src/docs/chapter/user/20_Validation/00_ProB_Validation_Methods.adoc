= ProB Validation Methods

ProB offers various validation techniques:

* <<consistency-checking,Consistency Checking (Finding Invariant
Violations using the Model Checker)>>
* <<constraint-based-checking,Constraint Based Checking>>
* <<refinement-checking,Refinement Checking>>
* <<ltl-model-checking,LTL Model Checking>>
* <<bounded-model-checking,Bounded Model Checking>>

Here we want to describe the advantages and disadvantages of the various
methods.
