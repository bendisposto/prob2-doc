== Tutorial Model Checking, Proof and CBC

We assume that you have completed
<<tutorial-complete-model-checking,Tutorial Complete Model
Checking>>.

Let us examine the following B machine:

....
MACHINE DoubleCounter
VARIABLES counter
INVARIANT
 counter:NATURAL & counter<=128
INITIALISATION counter:=8
OPERATIONS
  Double = PRE counter<100 THEN counter := 2*counter END;
  Halve = BEGIN counter := counter/2 END
END
....

Now click the "Model Check" button. After a short while, ProB will
give you the following message:

image::ProBModelCheckNoCounterExampleFound.png[]

Is this model correct? As you will see, this depends on your point of
view.

[[state-space]]
=== State Space

If you look purely at the state space of the machine (choose the View
State Space command in the Animate menu) you get the following picture:

image::DoubleCounterStatespace.png[]

Indeed, all reachable states are correct, in the sense that the
invariant `counter:NATURAL & counter\<=128` holds for all of those
states.

However, you will not be able to prove the system correct using AtelierB
or Rodin.

[[constraint-based-checking-cbc-for-the-invariant]]
=== Constraint Based Checking (CBC) for the Invariant

In addition to model checking, ProB also offers constraint-based
checking (CBC), which is particularly useful when used in conjunction
with proof. This will give us the clue as to why the above machine
cannot be proven correct, and why it can also be viewed as incorrect.

Before proceeding, please ensure that you have either set the CLPFD
preference to `TRUE` or have set the MAXINT preference to at least `130`.
This can be set by going to the "Animation Preferences" command in the
Preferences menu or by adding for example the following to your file and
then reloading it:

....
DEFINITIONS SET_PREF_CLPFD == TRUE
....

Let us choose the "Check Invariant Preservation for Operation" command
inside the "Constraint Based Checking" submenu:

image::DoubleCounterCBCCommand.png[]

(You This will report an invariant violation and transport you to the
following state:

image::CBCDoubleCounter2.png[]

As you can see, the Counter has the value 130, which clearly violates
the invariant `counter\<=128`. However, no value in the state space above
had this value for Counter. So how did we reach this error state? By
pressing the left arrow in the "EnabledOperations" pane you will see
the previous state that ProB has computed:

image::CBCDoubleCounter1.png[]

Now, while this state does not appear in the state space above either.
However, this time this state does satisfy the invariant. Thus, if we
ignore the initialization and just look at the INVARIANT
`counter:NATURAL & counter\<=128` as describing all possible states, then
the machine is indeed erroneous: the operation Double lead us outside of
the safe states. The operation Halve on the other hand is correct: for
every possible state satisfying the INVARIANT the resulting successor
state will also satisfy the INVARIANT.

If you look purely at the state space of the machine (choose the View
State Space command in the Animate menu) you get the following picture:

image::DoubleCounterStatespace2.png[]

As you can see the constraint-based checker has transported us into the
state with `counter=65`, which is not reachable from the initial state of
the system. However, as we have said, it does satisfy the invariant and
as such the machine cannot be proven using the B provers.

If one tries to use for example Click'n Prove to prove this machine,
there is one proof obligation for the Double operation which cannot be
discharged:

image::ClicknProveDoubleCounter.png[]

Indeed, we have to prove that `2*counter` is less or equal to `128`, given
that counter is less or equal to `99` and less or equal to `128`. This is
not possible; above ProB has found `counter=65` as a counterexample. More
generally, the proof obligation in classical B for an operation with
precondition `P` and body `S` is:

`I & P \=> [S] I`

In other words, for any state which satisfies the invariant I and the
precondition `P`, the operation must preserve the invariant; not just for
the states reachable from the initialization. In particular, the
operation must preserve the invariant for the state with `counter=65`,
which it does not.
