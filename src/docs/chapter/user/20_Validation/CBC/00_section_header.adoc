ProB also offers an alternative checking method, inspired by the Alloy
footnote:[D. Jackson: Alloy: A lightweight object modeling notation. ACM
Transactions Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM),
11(2):256â€“290, 2002.] analyser. In this mode of operation, ProB does not
explore the reachable states starting from the initial state(s), but
checks whether applying a single operation can result in a property
violation (invariant and assertion) independently of the particular
initialization of the B machine. This is done by symbolic constraint
solving, and we call this approach constraint based checking (another
sensible name would be model finding).

More details and examples can be found in the

checking, proof and CBC>>.
