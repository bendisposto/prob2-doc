[[project-view]]
= Project View

If no machine or no project has been opened, the Project View will allow
you to create a project. If you choose to open a machine without having
a project, a default project will be created.

The Project View contains several tabs:

* *Project*, containing name and description
* *Machines*, containing machines added to this project
* *Verifications*, containing the verification status of each machine
* *Preferences*, containing custom preferences
* *Run Configurations*, containing machines paired with preferences
(each pair has its own entry)
