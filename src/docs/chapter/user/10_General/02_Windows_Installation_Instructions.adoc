not be able to parse your own classical B machines as our parser is
written in Java.

* Tcl/Tk: be sure to have a matching version of TclTk 8.5 installed

install the

Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package (x86)] for yourself (rather than
rely on the ones we provide in the `Microsoft.VC80.CRT` folder
mentioned above).

error messages may help you or us uncover the problem

Event/Error Log, by following these steps:
** Click Start, and then click Control Panel.

and then double-click Computer Management. Or, open the MMC containing
the Event Viewer snap-in.

contains the event that you want to view.
** In the details pane, double-click the event that you want to view.
** The Event Properties dialog box containing header information and a
description of the event is displayed.
