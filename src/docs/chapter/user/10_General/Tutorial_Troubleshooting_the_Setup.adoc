= Tutorial Troubleshooting the Setup

:category: Tutorial


We assume that you have grasped the way that ProB setups up the initial
states of a B machine as outlined in
<<tutorial-setup-phases,Tutorial Setup Phases>>.

In this lesson, we examine what can go wrong in these phases and how one
can find a solution. Indeed, setting up the constants and initial values
of a machine is often the most difficult step for an animator.
Unfortunately, it is also the very first step an animator has to
perform.

We will also learn to use the various predicate analysis features
provided by ProB.

[[simple-inconsistency-in-the-properties]]
Simple Inconsistency in the PROPERTIES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, open the machine "Jukebox.mch" which can be found in the
SchneiderBook/Jukebox_Chapter13 subdirectory of the ProB Examples
folder. The main ProB window should look more or less as follows:

image::ProB_JukeboxAfterLoad.png[]

Now edit the file, and type `& limit>99` after `PROPERTIES limit:NAT1`.
Save the machine and reload it. Hint: there is a "Save and reopen"
command in the "File" menu for this action.

ProB should now popup the following message:
image::ProB_Jukebox_UnsatProp.png[]

If you click "Yes" (or Ja), you will get the following window:

image::ProB_Jukebox_DebugUnsatProp.png[]

What ProB does is add conjuncts from the PROPERTIES (and CONSTRAINTS
clause) one-by-one, until it can no longer find a solution. This can
often give you an indication of what is wrong, and the source of the
trouble (or inconsistency).

An alternate means to figure out the source of the problem is ProB's
graphical formula viewer. For this, choose the ``Analyse
Graphically/Properties'' in the "Analyse" menu:

image::ProB_Jukebox_AnalyseGraphicallyCommand.png[]

This will result in the following visualization:

image::ProB_Jukebox_AnalyseGraphicallyUnsatProp.png[]

This viewer uses another, more sophisticated algorithm to determine a
maximal subset of the Properties which is satisfiable. In this case, it
has determined `limit=1` to make `limit:NAT1` true (but which obviously
does not make `limit>99` true.

In any way, the problem here is that we have set MAXINT to 3, and hence
`NAT1={1,2,3}`. To make our PROPERTIES satisfiable again, we could add
for example

....
DEFINITIONS
 SET_PREF_MAXINT==255
....

to the machine and re-load it. As we can see, the problem is solved and
we can proceed with animation of the machine:

image::ProB_JukeboxAfterLoad2.png[]

[[a-more-involved-inconsistency]]
A more involved inconsistency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us add

....
& !x.(x<limit => x<99)
....

to the PROPERTIES of the machine and then save and reopen it. We again
get the error message that ProB cannot find CONSTANTS which satisfy the
PROPERTIES. If click on the "Yes" button to debug the PROPERTIES we
get the following picture:

image::ProB_Jukebox_DebugUnsatProp2.png[]

We can see that ProB has found the solution `limit=100` for the first
two properties and then got stuck. Using the graphical viewer results
the following visualization:

image::ProB_Jukebox_AnalyseGraphicallyUnsatProp2.png[]

Here we can see that ProB has used another partial solution, namely
`limit=1`, which also satisfies two properties (and fails to satisfy
`limit>99`).

If the feedback provided by ProB is not sufficient to locate the
problem, one can try to comment out parts of the PROPERTIES by hand
until they become satisfiable. One can also move them to the ASSERTIONS
clause, which has the advantage that we can check them later. Let us
move the last property into an assertion:

....
PROPERTIES        limit : NAT1 & limit>99
ASSERTIONS        !x.(x<limit => x<99)
....

Now save and reopen the machine. This time the properties are
satisfiable. After selecting SETUP_CONSTANTS(100) and
INITIALISATION(\{}) we obtain the following picture:

image::ProB_JukeboxAfterInit3.png[]

We can now analyze the ASSERTIONS. For this, choose the ``Analyse
Graphically/Assertions'' in the "Analyse" menu:

image::ProB_Jukebox_AnalyseGraphicallyUnsatAssertion3.png[]

The graphical viewer gives us an instance where the universally
quantified formula is false: `x=99`, which hopefully helps us in fixing
the problem, e.g., writing `!x.(x``x<=99)`.

Note, that ProB also allows us to inspect custom predicates using the
graphical viewer (without saving and reopening a machine). For this,
choose the "Analyse Graphically/Custom Predicate..." in the
"Analyse" menu and enter `!x.(x``x<=99)`:
image::ProB_Jukebox_AnalyseGraphicallyCustomCommand.png[] After
hitting OK we obtain:
image::ProB_Jukebox_AnalyseGraphicallyCustom3.png[]

As we can see, this predicate is true in that particular state of the
machine. Note, there is also the option to use ``Analyse
Predicate/Custom Predicate...''. This will result in a simpler
(non-graphical) visualization. Use this if the graphical visualization
is too large or takes too much time to compute. The custom predicate
analysis commands have one disadvantage: the formula has to be typed
into a single line inside the dialog box (and parse errors are not very
user-friendly). The alternatives are entering the formula into the
ASSERTIONS clause as above. One can also define a special GOAL predicate
in the DEFINITIONS:

....
DEFINITIONS       GOAL == !x.(x<limit => x<99)
....

Then one can use "Analyse Predicate/GOAL" or ``Analyse
Graphically/GOAL''. The GOAL predicate can also be used to guide the
model checker.

Finally, the "Analyse" commands can also be applied to the
precondition and guards of operations. This is useful to find out why a
particular operation is (maybe) unexpectedly disabled or enabled. For
this, choose the "Analyse Graphically/Operation PRE..." in the
"Analyse" menu and select the "select" operation:
image::ProB_Jukebox_AnalyseGraphicallyOperationPRE.png[]

After hitting "Select" or typing return we obtain, which shows us why
the operation is not enabled:
