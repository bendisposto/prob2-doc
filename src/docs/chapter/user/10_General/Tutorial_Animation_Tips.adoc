== Tutorial Animation Tips

Make sure you have the Lift.mch model from the first part of the
tutorial: link:/Tutorial_First_Step[Starting ProB and first animation
steps].

[[operation-with-many-solutions-for-the-parameters]]
=== Operation with many solutions for the parameters

Add the following operation to the Lift model:

....
jump(level) = PRE level : 0..99 THEN floor := level END
....

Now reload your model and initialise the machine. Your ProB window
should now look as follows:

image::ProB_LiftWithJump.png[]

As you can see, only 10 values for the level parameter of the jump
operation are displayed in the "Enabled Operations" pane. The orange
"max" button to the left of "Enabled Operation" tells you that not
all possible parameter values for the operations were computed.

There are several solutions to overcome this.

[[increasing-max_operations]]
==== Increasing MAX_OPERATIONS

First, you could increase the "MAX_OPERATIONS" preference of ProB by
selecting the "Animation Preferences" command in the _Preferences_
menu:

image::ProB_Lift_MAX_OPERATIONS.png[]

You should then set the preference "MAX_OPERATIONS" to at least 101 and then re-load
the B machine.

[[executing-an-operation-by-predicate]]
==== Executing an Operation by Predicate

The alternative is to provide the parameter value for `level` yourself.
For this, select the "Execute an Operation..." command in the _Animate_
menu:

image::ProB_Lift_ExecuteOperationMenu.png[]

After that, select the `jump` operation

image::ProB_ExecuteOperation.png[]

and you will be provided with the following dialog:

image::ProB_Lift_ExecuteOperation_Dialog.png[]

Type in `98` into the level field and hit the "Execute" button.

Note: instead or in addition to providing concrete values, you can also
specify a predicate that constrains the values of the parameters:

image::ProB_Lift_ExecuteOperation_Dialog_Pred.png[]

The above predicate, `level>96 & level mod 2 =0` would select the same
value `98` for level. When there are multiple solutions, ProB will only
execute the operation for the first solution found.

[[using-random-enumeration]]
==== Using Random enumeration

You can also tell ProB to try and perform random enumerations. This
feature is available in ProB 1.5.0 or newer. You add the following lines
to your model:

`DEFINITIONS` +
`SET_PREF_RANDOMISE_ENUMERATION_ORDER == TRUE`

Alternatively, you can set this preference using the "Advanced
Preferences" pane in the _Preferences_ menu. After reloading the machine
you should see a picture similar to the following one:

image::ProB_Lift_Randomise.png[]

==== Using Constraint-Based Validation Techniques

[[find-sequence]]
===== Find Sequence

You can also use the constraint solver to construct sequences which are
of interest to you. Let us add the following operation to the lift
model:

`top_reached = PRE floor=99 THEN skip END`

Now suppose we want to execute this new operation as early as possible.
We can ask the constraint solver to generate a feasible sequence of
operations. First select the "Find Sequence..." command in the _Verify_
menu:

image::FindSequenceMenu.png[]

Now type in

`jump ; top_reached`

in this dialog box:

image::FindSequenceDialog.png[]

ProB will then find a solution operation sequence for you and execute
it:

image::FindSequenceResult.png[]

[[constraint-based-model-based-testing]]
===== Constraint-Based Model-Based Testing

Alternatively, you could for example use the constraint-based test-case
generator to find for every operation the shortest trace that enables
it.

First select the "Constraint-based Testcase Generation.." command in
the _Analyse_ menu:

image::CBCMBTMenu.png[]

Now click on the ok button in the dialog box (which allows you to select
the target operations to cover in the generated test cases):

image::CBCMBTDialog.png[]

ProB will then find four test cases for you, one for each operation:

image::CBCMBTResult.png[]

You can also visualise these test cases as a tree by clicking the "View
Tree" button:

image::CBCMBTTreeResult.png[]

Green entries show test cases (traces which cover an operation in the
shortest possible way), gray entries are traces which did not contribute
to a test case.

More details are available in the
<<tutorial-model-based-testing,Tutorial_Model-Based_Testing>> and
<<tutorial-model-checking-proof-and-cbc,Tutorial_Model_Checking,_Proof_and_CBC>>
sections.
