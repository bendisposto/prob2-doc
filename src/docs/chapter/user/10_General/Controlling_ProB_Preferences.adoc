= Controlling ProB Preferences

ProB provides a variety of preferences to control its behaviour. A list
of the most important preferences can be found
link:/Using_the_Command-Line_Version_of_ProB#Preferences[in the manual
page for probcli]. We also have a separate link:/Deferred_Sets[manual
page about setting the sizes of deferred sets].

[[setting-preferences-in-a-b-machine]]
== Setting Preferences in a B machine

This only works for classical B models. For a preference `P` you can add
the following definition to the `DEFINITIONS` section of the main
machine:

`SET_PREF_P == VAL`

This will set the preference `P` to the value `VAL` for this model only.

[[setting-preferences-from-the-command-line]]
== Setting Preferences from the command-line

You can set a preference `P` to a value `VAL` for a particular run of
probcli by adding the command-line switch `-p P VAL`, e.g.,

`probcli -p P VAL mymachine.mch -mc 9999`

You can obtain a list of preferences by calling
<<using-the-command-line-version-of-prob,probcli>> as
follows:

`probcli -help -v`

You can use a preference file generated by ProB Tcl/Tk:

`-prefs FILE`

This will import all preferences from this file, as set by ProB Tcl/Tk.

You can also set the scope for a particular link:/Deferred_Sets[deferred
set] `GS` using the following command-line switch:

`-card GS Val`

[[setting-preferences-from-prob-tcltk]]
== Setting Preferences from ProB Tcl/Tk

ProB Tcl/Tk stores your preferences settings in a file
`ProB_Preferences.pl`.

The ProB preferences are grouped into various categories. In the
_Preferences_ Menu you can modify the preferences for each category:

For example, if you choose the graphical viewer preferences you will get
this dialog:
