== Tutorial Setup Phases

We assume that you have grasped the first steps of opening and animating
a B machine as outlined in <<tutorial-first-step,Tutorial First
Step>>.

In this lesson, we examine more closely the various steps that ProB
undertakes before a machine can be animated.

First, open the machine "Jukebox.mch" which can be found in the
SchneiderBook/Jukebox_Chapter13 subdirectory of the ProB Examples
folder. The main ProB window should look more or less as follows:

In general, before the operations of a machine can be applied, ProB
needs to traverse three phases:

* 1. Loading the machine and determining the sizes of the deferred sets,
as well as fixing the values of MININT and MAXINT.
* 2. Setting up the constants of the machine, such that the PROPERTIES
and CONSTRAINTS are satisfied.
* 3. Performing a valid initialisation of the machine.

This process is illustrated in the following picture:

We now examine these phases on the Jukebox machine in more detail

[[loading]]
=== 1. Loading

Here ProB parses and type checks the machine.

Then it will fix the values of MININT and MAXINT. There are two ways you
can influence this:

* by using "Animation Preferences..." command in the _Preferences_
menu and modifying the corresponding preferences.
* by including a "DEFINITIONS" section in your machine (if there is
not yet one) and then adding a definition of the form
`SET_PREF_MAXINT == 5` or `SET_PREF_MININT == -2147483648`.

Note that these preferences determine the elements of the sets `INT`
(implementable integers), `NAT` (implementable natural numbers) and
`NAT1`. In addition, they are used to control the enumeration of
variables of type `INTEGER` (mathematical integers), in case a definite
value cannot be inferred from the machine.

Afterwards, ProB will determine the cardinality of all deferred sets
(such as `TRACK` in the Jukebox machine). There are several ways you can
influence this:

* by using "Animation Preferences..." command in the _Preferences_
menu and modifying the preference ``Size of unspecified deferred sets in
SETS section''.
* by including a "DEFINITIONS" section in your machine (if there is
not yet one) and then adding a definition of the form `scope_TRACK == 5`
(where `TRACK` is the name of the deferred set you wish to influence and
5 is its desired cardinality). This will override the default size.
* by including a predicate of the form `card(TRACK)=5` in the
`PROPERTIES` or `CONSTRAINTS` section of your machine.

As you can see above in the "State Properties" pane, ProB has chosen
MAXINT=3, MININT=-1 and card(TRACK)=2. If you wish to change these
settings, perform the steps above and reload the machine. Hint: there is
a "Reopen" command in the _File_ menu:

[[setup_constants]]
=== 2. SETUP_CONSTANTS

In this phase ProB will try and find values for the constants and
parameters of your machine, so that the `PROPERTIES` and `CONSTRAINTS`
are true. Note that ProB will *not* (yet) modify the settings from phase
1 for MAXINT, MININT and the size of the deferred sets.

ProB will initiate this phase automatically, and as we can see above,
ProB has found three distinct ways to setup the constant limit. Observe
that a little orange button labeled max has appeared in the ``Enabled
Operations'' pane. This means that there might actually be more than
three ways to setup the constants. We will return to this issue later.

By double clicking on "SETUP_CONSTANTS(2)" we proceed to the next
phase:

[[initialisation]]
=== 3. INITIALISATION

In this phase the values for the constants have been found, but the
initial values of the variables still remain to be determined. For this,
ProB will try to execute the `INITIALISATION` substitution. As we can
see above, ProB has found just one possible way to initialise the
variables `credit` and `playset`. Double-clicking on
INITIALISATION(0,\{}) leads the animator into a state where all
constants and variables are valued, and where the `INVARIANT` can be
checked and operations can be applied:

Let us conclude by choosing the "View Statespace" command in the
_Animate_ menu:

image::ProB_Jukebox_Statespace.png[]

As you can see, there is only one root node (inverted triangle): in
order to change MAXINT, MININT or the deferred set sizes you have to
reload the machine. There are, however, three different ways to setup
the constants. The model checker will explore all of them. Let us choose
the "Model Check..." command in the _Verify_ menu and then press on
the "Model Check" button.

If we now choose the "View Statespace" command in the _Animate_
menu, we get the following picture:

image::ProB_Jukebox_StatespaceFull.png[]

We can see (or guess at
least) that ProB has validated the machine and explored the statespace
not just for `limit=2` but also for `limit=1` and `limit=3`.
