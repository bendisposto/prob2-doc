= Colours of enabled operations

The enabled operations are shown in different colours, depending on the
state where the operation leads to. If more than one rule of the
following list apply, the first colour is taken:

blue : The operation does not change the state (behaves like skip). +
green : The operation leads to a new, not yet explored state. +
red : The operation leads to a state where the invariant is violated. +
orange : The operation leads to a deadlock state, i.e. a state where no
operation is enabled. +
black : Otherwise, the operation leads to a state that is different to
the current state, has already been visited and is neither an invariant
violating or deadlock state.::
