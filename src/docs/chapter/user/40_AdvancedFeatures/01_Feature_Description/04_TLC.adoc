== TLC

As of version 1.4.0, ProB can make use of
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tlc.html[TLC]
as an alternative model checker to validate B specifications. TLC is an
efficient model checker for TLA+ specifications, which can check LTL
properties with fairness. It is particularly good for lower level
specifications, where it can be substantially faster than ProB's own
model checker. TLC has been released as an open source project, under
the
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/license.html[MIT
License].

=== How to use TLC

[[using-tlc-in-prob-tcltk]]
==== Using TLC in ProB Tcl/Tk

First you have to open a B specification in the ProB GUI. Then you can
select the menu command "Model Check with TLC" in the
"Verify->External Tools" menu.

You can use TLC to find the following kinds of errors in the B
specification:

* Deadlocks
* Invariant violations
* Assertion errors
* Goal found (a desired state is reached)
* Properties violations (i.e, axioms over the B constants are false)
* Well-definedness violations
* Temporal formulas violations

In some cases, TLC reports a trace leading to the state where the error
(e.g. deadlock or invariant violation) occur. Such traces are
automatically replayed in the ProB animator (displayed in the history
pane) to give an optimal feedback.

[[requirements]]
===== Requirements

On Linux the tlc-thread package is required to run TLC from the tcl/tk
ui:

`sudo apt-get install tcl-thread`

[[using-tlc-in-probcli]]
==== Using TLC in probcli

You can use the following switch to use TLC rather than ProB's model
checker:

`-mc_with_tlc`

Some of the standard probcli options also work for TLC:

* -noinv (no invariant checking)
* -nodead (no deadlock checking)
* -noass (no assertion checking)
* -nogoal (no checking for the optional goal predicate)

In addition you can provide

* -noltl (no checking of LTL assertions)

The preference `TLC_WORKERS` influences the number of workers that will
be used by TLC. So, a call might look like this:

`probcli FILE.mch -mc_with_tlc -p TLC_WORKERS 2 -noltl`

[[when-to-use-tlc]]
=== When to use TLC

TLC is extremely valuable when it comes to explicit state model checking
for large state spaces. Otherwise, TLC has no constraint solving
abilities.

[[translation-from-b-to-tla]]
Translation from B to TLA+
--------------------------

TLC is a very efficient model checker for specifications written in
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tla.html[TLA+].
To validate B specification with TLC we developed the translator TLC4B
which automatically translates a B specification to TLA+, invokes the
model checker TLC, and translates the results back to B. Counter
examples produced by TLC are double checked by ProB and replayed in the
ProB animator. The translation to TLA+ and back to B is completely
hidden to the user. Hence, the user needs no knowledge of TLA+ to use
TLC.

There is a
http://stups.hhu.de/w/Special:Publication/HansenLeuschel_TLC4B_techreport[technical
report] that describes our translation from B to TLA+.

[[limitations-tlc]]
=== Limitations

The following constructs are currently not supported by the TLC4B
translator:

* Refinement specifications
* Machine inclusion (SEES, INCLUDES, ..)
* Sequential composition statement (G;H)

[[visited-states]]
=== Visited States

Sometimes TLC will show a different number of visited states compared to
the ProB model checker. The following example should illustrate this
issue:

....
MACHINE NumberOfStates
CONSTANTS k
PROPERTIES
k : 1..10
VARIABLES x
INVARIANT
x : NATURAL
INITIALISATION x := k
END
....

ProB will report 21 distinct states (1 root state, 10 constant setup
states, 10 initialization states):

TLC will only report 10 distinct states (10 initialization states).
