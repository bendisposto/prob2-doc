This tutorial describes, how ProB's integrated plugin for unit analysis
can be used with Event-B machines from inside the Rodin platform. This
includes

1.  Annotating variables with their physical unit,
2.  Infer the unit of variables without an annotation,
3.  Detect incorrect usage of units, like addition of differently
annotated variables.

Both the plugin itself and the bridge to Rodin are a work in progress.
Preliminary support is available in the nightly builds of ProB for Rodin
and will be merged in the regular releases in the future.

We assume that you have a general understanding of Event-B and the usage
of ProB / Rodin.

Installing Physical Units Support for ProB for Rodin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can follow the link:/Tutorial_Rodin_First_Step[First Steps
Instructions] or the
http://www.stups.uni-duesseldorf.de/ProB/index.php5/Installation#Installation_Instruction_for_ProB_.28Rodin_Plugin.29[Screencast]
to install ProB for Rodin.

In addition to the ``ProB for Rodin2'' plugin there is a ``ProB for
Rodin2 - Physical Units Support'' plugin at out Rodin update site. You
have to install both to enable physical units support for Rodin.

Attaching Physical Units to Variables and Constants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once both plugins are installed, ProB allows to annotate both variables
and constants with physical units:

We store the user supplied unit and the units inferred by ProB as a new
attribute in the Rodin database.

Units can be supplied in two forms:

* by using an alias like ``m'', ``cm'', ``mps'' and so on,
* or by using an Event-B Expression in an SI unit compatible form, like
``10^2 * m^2''.

Starting the Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The supplied units can now be used by ProB to infer missing units,
verify the supplied units and detect unit errors. To start the analysis
use the context menu of the machine / context you want to analyse:

Necessary machines and contexts will be translated and passed to ProB.
Once the analysis is finished, the ``inferred unit'' text fields are
filled with the resulting units.

[[possible-errors]]
Possible Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inside the Rodin Errors view, several errors might occur:

* An invalid unit has been supplied. Please check your input to the
corresponding ``Physical Unit'' attribute.
* Multiple units have been inferred for a variable or constant.

Furthermore, we output a warning if no unit could be inferred for a
variable or constant.
