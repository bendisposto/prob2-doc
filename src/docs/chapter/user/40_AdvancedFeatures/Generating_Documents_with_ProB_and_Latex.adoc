= Generating Documents with ProB and Latex

ProB can (as of version 1.6.1) be used to process Latex files, i.e., the
command-line tool probcli scans a given Latex file and replaces certain
commands by processed results.

[[usage]]
Usage
~~~~~

A typical usage would be as follows:

....
   probcli FILE -init -latex Raw.tex Final.tex
....

Note: the FILE and -init commands are optional; they are required in
case you want to process the commands in the context of a certain model.
Currently the probcli Latex commands mainly support B and Event-B
models, TLA+ and Z models can also be processed but all commands below
expect B syntax. You can add more commands if you wish, e.g., set
preferences using `-p PREF VAL` or run model checking `--model-check`.
The Latex processing will take place after most other commands, such as
model checking.

You will probably want to put the probcli call into a Makefile, in
particular when you want to generate dot graphics using ProB.

The distribution folder of ProB contains an example with a Makefile,
producing the following file, which at the same time documents the core
features:



[[commands]]
Commands
~~~~~~~~

The commands are described in the PDF document above. Here is a short
summary of some of the commands:

* `\probexpr{EXRP}` command takes a B expression `EXPR`as argument and
evaluates it. By default it shows the B expression and the value of the
expression. Example: `\probexpr` will be replaced by `{1,1024}`
** `ascii` to print the result as ASCII rather than using Latex math
symbols
** `time` to display the time taken for the command
** `string` the result value is a string, and do not print the quotes
around the string
** `value` to just print the value, not the expression

* `\probrepl{CMD}` command takes a probcli REPL command `CMD` as
argument and executes it. By default it shows only the output of the
execution, e.g., in case it is a predicate TRUE or FALSE. Example:
`\probrepl{let DOM = 1..3}`. A variation of the latter is the new
command `\problet{DOM}{1..3}` which shows the let construct itself
within the generated Latex. Optional arguments for `\probrepl` are :
** `solution` to display the solution bindings (for existential
variables) found by ProB
** `store` to store the solution bindings as local variables (similar to
let)
** `ascii` to print the result as ASCII rather than using Latex math
symbols
** `time` to display the time taken for the command
** `print` to print the expression/predicate being evaluated
(automatically set by `\problet`
** `silent` to not print the result of the evaluation

* `\probtable{EXRP}` command takes a B expression `EXPR`as argument,
evaluates it and shows it as a Latex table. Optional arguments are
`no-tabular`, `no-hline`, `no-headings`, `no-row-numbers`,
`max-table-size=NR`.

* `\probdot{DOT}{File1}` command takes a B expression `EXPR`as argument,
evaluates it as a graph and writes a dot file `File1`. You can provide a
second File as argument, in which case `dot` is called to generate a PDF
document. You can also set `sfdp` as third argument, in which case the
`sfdp` tool will be used instead of `dot`.

* `\probprint{EXRP}` command takes a B expression or predicate `EXPR`as
argument and pretty prints it. Optional arguments are:
** `pred` only try to parse first argument as predicate
** `expr` only try to parse first argument as expression
** `ascii` to print the result as ASCII rather than using Latex math
symbols

* `\probif{EXPR}{Then}{Else}` command takes an expression or predicate
`EXPR` and two Latex texts. If the expression evaluates to TRUE the
first branch `Then` is processed, otherwise the other one `Else` is
processed.

* `\probfor{ID}{Set}{Body}` command takes an identifier `ID`, a set
expression `Set` and a Latex text `Body`, and processes the Latex text
for every element of the set expression, setting the identifier to a
value of the set.
