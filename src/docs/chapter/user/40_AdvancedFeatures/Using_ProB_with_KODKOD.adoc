= Using ProB with KODKOD

:category: User_Manual

:category: Stubs


As of version 1.3.5 ProB can make use of
http://alloy.mit.edu/kodkod/[Kodkod] as an alternate way of solving
constraints. Kodkod provides a relational interface to SAT solvers and
is the heart of the http://alloy.mit.edu/alloy/[Alloy] tool.

[[how-to-enable-kodkod]]
How to enable Kodkod
--------------------

For the command-line version you need to call prob as follows:

`probcli -p KODKOD TRUE`

Note: to experiment with Kodkod you may want to try out the command:

`probcli -p KODKOD TRUE -repl`

If in addition you want see a graphical representation of the solutions
found you can use the following command and open the `out.dot` file
using dotty or GraphViz:

`probcli -p KODKOD TRUE -repl -evaldot ~/out.dot`

For the ProB Tcl/Tk Version you should select the menu command ``Enable
Kodkod for Properties'' in the Preferences menu.

[[what-can-be-translated]]
What can be translated
----------------------

* Types:
** Basic Types: Deferred Sets, enumerated sets, integers, booleans
** Sets of basic types
** Relations between basic types
** Higher-order types (sets of sets) are not supported

* Operators:
** Predicates: &, or, =>, <=>, not, !, #, =, /=
** Booleans: TRUE, FALSE, BOOL, bool(...)
** Sets: \{..,...} \{x|P}, POW, card, Cartesian product, \/, /\, -, :,
/:, /<:, <<: /<<:
** Numbers: n..m, >, <, >=, <=, +, -, *, SIGMA(x).(P|x)
** Relations: <->, |->, dom, ran, id, <|, <<|, |>, |>>, ~, [...], <+,
prj1, prj2, closure1
** x : S+->T, x:S-->T, ..., lambda
** currently no operations on sequences are supported

* Some limitations:
** If integers are used, a predicate can only be translated if a static
analysis can estimate the interval of its possible values.
** Generally only complete predicates are translated or nothing at all,
unless you set the `KODKOD_ONLY_FULL` preference to FALSE.

[[when-is-the-kokod-translation-used]]
When is the Kokod translation used
----------------------------------

Once enabled, the Kodkod translation will be used in the following
circumstances:

* for solving PROPERTIES
* constraint-based assertion checking (`-cbc_assertions` command for
`probcli` or the "Check Assertions on Constants" command in the menu
Verify -> Constraint-Based Checking)
* constraint-based deadlock checking
* in the <<eval-console,Eval Console>> in the ProB Tcl/Tk version
* for the REPL in probcli (`probcli -p KODKOD TRUE -repl`)

[[sat-solver]]
SAT solver
----------

By default Kodkod in ProB uses the bundled SAT4J solver. You can switch
to using minisat by putting a current version of `libminisat.jnilib`
into ProB's `lib` directory.

Similarly, as of ProB 1.6.1-beta5 you can also use the Solver
http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/[lingeling] or
http://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/[glucose] by dropping
`liblingeling.dylib` or `libglucose.dylib` into ProB's lib folder (for
Mac OS X; for Linux the extension will be different). You can control
the solver being used using the `KODKOD_SAT_SOLVER` preference (which
has four possible values: sat4j, minisat, lingeling, glucose).

These files can be downloaded from the
http://alloy.mit.edu/kodkod/download.html[Kodkod download site].

[[more-preferences]]
More Preferences
----------------

If you set `KODKOD_ONLY_FULL` to `FALSE`, then the Kodkod translation
can be applied to part of a predicate. In other words, the predicate
(such as the PROPERTIES) are partitioned into two parts: one that can be
understood by Kodkod and the rest which will be dealt with by ProB's
solver.

You can also enable symmetry by using the preference `KODKOD_SYMMETRY`.
By default, ProB will set this value to 0, i.e., symmetry is off. This
means that Kodkod can also be used within set comprehensions. By setting
the preference to a value higher than 0 you will enable symmetry within
Kodkod, which may mean that not all solutions will be returned. Setting
the value too high may be counter productive; Kodkod's recommended
default is 20.

Finally, you can control the number of solutions that Kodkod computes in
one go using the preference `KODKOD_MAX_NR_SOLS`. E.g., if you are
interested in only one solution and `KODKOD_ONLY_FULL` is `TRUE`, then
you should set this value to 1.
