== Installation

First you need to download the Rodin platform (e.g,
http://sourceforge.net/projects/rodin-b-sharp/files/Core_Rodin_Platform/3.3/[Rodin
3.3],) if you have not already done so.

Continue by installing the ProB for Rodin Plugin by choosing "Install
new software..." in the _Help_ menu.

In the dialog box you should then select the ProB for Rodin update site,
and then select the various components of ProB as shown below. (the
update site for Rodin 3.x is
https://www3.hhu.de/stups/rodin/prob1/release/3[Installing the ProB plug-ins]
for stable builds, and
https://www3.hhu.de/stups/rodin/prob1/nightly[https://www3.hhu.de/stups/rodin/prob1/nightly].
for nightly builds, in case you want to type it by hand).

As you can see, the `changer` event is enabled, and there are two
distinct ways to choose the parameters of the event. Double-click on an
EVENT to execute it. If you want to control which parameters are used,
right click on the EVENT and choose the desired parameter values:

As you can see, the values of the variables have been updated. Values
that have changed are marked with a star. The history pane has also been
updated. You can click on an event in the history to return back to the
corresponding state. You can also click on the left arrow in the Events
pane to go back one step at a time (once you stepped back you can also
step forward again; this works just like in a web browser).
