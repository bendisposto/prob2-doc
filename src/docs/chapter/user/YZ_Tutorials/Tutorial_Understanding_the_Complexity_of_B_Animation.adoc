= Tutorial Understanding the Complexity of B Animation

We assume that you have grasped the way that ProB setups up the initial
states of a B machine as outlined in
<<tutorial-setup-phases,Tutorial Setup Phases>>.

In this lesson, we examine the complexity of animation of B models in
general, how ProB solves this problem, and what the ramification for
users are.

[[undecidability]]
== Undecidability

In general, animation of a B model is undecidable. More precisely, it is
undecidable to find out

* whether a solution to the PROPERTIES can be found,
* whether a valid INITIALISATION exists and
* whether any given operation can be applied.

For example, the following B machine encodes Goldbach's conjecture (that
every even number greater than 2 is a Goldbach number, i.e., it can be
expressed as the sum of two primes):

....
MACHINE Goldbach
DEFINITIONS
  prime(x) == x>1 & !y.(y:NATURAL & y>1 & y<x => x mod y /= 0)
OPERATIONS
  GoldbachNumber(x,p1,p2) = SELECT x:NATURAL & x mod 2 = 0 & x>2 &
         p1<x & p2<x & p1<=p2 & prime(p1) & prime(p2) & x = p1+p2 THEN
  skip
 END;
  NotGoldbachNumber(x) = SELECT x:NATURAL & x mod 2 = 0 & x>2 &
      !(p1,p2).(p1<x & p2<x & p1<=p2 & prime(p1) & prime(p2) => x /= p1+p2) THEN
  skip
 END
END
....

If the conjecture is true, then the operation NotGoldbachNumber is
disabled; if the conjecture is false then it is enabled.

How does ProB overcome undecidability? First, it will enumerate integer
variables only between MININT and MAXINT (unless the machine itself
fixes the value to be outside of that range). Hence, ProB will look for
solutions to the parameter `x` of NotGoldbachNumber only until MAXINT.
Hence, if we set MAXINT to 16 (adding a definiton
`SET_PREF_MAXINT == 16`) we get the following picture after executing
the INITIALISATION:

We can see that 10 can be expressed as the sum 5+5 or 3+7. At least
until 16, Goldbach's conjecture is confirmed, as NotGoldbachNumber is
disabled.

Note, that this restriction (of enumerating only between MININT and
MAXINT) means that ProB is in general incomplete and sometimes unsound
when using mathematical integers. We recommend using the implementable
integers only (INT, NAT, NAT1). In future, we plan to integrate an
interval analysis into ProB so as to highlight predicates over
mathematical integers which are potentially problematic.

The mathematical integers are, however, not the only source of
undecidability. Another source stems from the deferred sets. Indeed, the
size of those sets can be unknown, and they may even be infinite. To
overcome this issue, ProB is required to fix the cardinality of every
deferred set to a finite number before animation (see also
<<tutorial-setup-phases,Understanding the ProB Setup Phases>> on how
you can control the cardinality of the deferred sets).

[[complexity-of-animation]]
== Complexity of Animation

However, after addressing the undecidability issue, there is still the
problem of complexity. The animation task can be arbitrarily complex
even for finite sets and implementable integers. Take for example the
following predicate, which declares `rr` to be a binary relation over
-3..3:

....
 rr : (-3..3) <-> (-3..3)
....

This predicate could be part of a precondition of an operation. In order
to find possible ways to enable the operation, the possible values for
`rr` need to be examined. Even if ProB did enumerate 100,000 candidate
solutions for `rr` per second, it would take over 178 years to check all
solutions for `rr`. Indeed, there are 49 possible pairs of values
between -3 and 3 and hence 2^49 = 562,949,953,421,312 binary relations
over -3..3.

The following table shows how the size of a deferred set S influences
the number of subsets, partial functions, relations over S, and a total
function over relations of S:

.__Number of distinct solutions__
[cols=",,,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|`card(S)` |`sub:POW(S)` |`pf:S+->S` |`rl: S<->S`
|`tclos: (S<->S) --> (S<->S)`
|1 |2 |2 |2 |4

|2 |4 |9 |16 |1.84e+19

|3 |8 |64 |512 |overflow (1.40e+1387)

|4 |16 |624 |65,536 |overflow (6.74e+315652)

|5 |32 |7,776 |33,554,432 |overflow

|6 |64 |117,649 |6.87e+10 |overflow

|7 |128 |2,097,152 |5.63e+14 |overflow

|8 |256 |43,046,721 |1.85e+19 |overflow

|9 |512 |1,000,000,000 |2.42e+24 |overflow

|n |2^n |(n+1)^n |2^n*n |(2^n*n)^(2^n*n)
|=======================================================================

tclos is actually the type of a function that does appear in some models
(often Event-B models): namely, the transitive closure which gets a
relation as argument and computes its transitive closure. As you can
see, we already run into problems with a `card(S)=2`. (Note that the age
of the universe is about 4e+17 seconds and 4e+26 nanoseconds.) For
`card(S)=3` the number of possible solutions (512^512) can no longer be
represented as a standard floating point number (it is roughly 1.40e1387
and is a number with 1388 digits).

In order to make a B model amenable to animation, we have three options:

* use small cardinalities for the deferred sets and avoid using overly
complicated datastructures (e.g., relations over relations or total
functions over relations)

* ensure that ProB does not have to enumerate variables with complicated
types, by providing concrete values (e.g., in the form of an equality
such as `rel = {1|->2, 2|->3, 3|->1}`)

* hope that the constraint solver of ProB will be able to find a
solution.

In the next part of the tutorial, we will explain in more detail how the
constraint solver of ProB works, so that you will be in a better
position to write specifications which can be successfully animated or
validated.
