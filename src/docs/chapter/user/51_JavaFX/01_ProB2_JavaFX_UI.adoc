The Perspectives submenu allows you to change the appearance of the main
view. The default view is shown at the top and two additional
perspectives (Seperated History and Seperated History and Statistics)
are preset. By _Detach Components_ the view can be shown in seperate
windows. _Load_ allows you to make your own perspective by providing an
FXML file containing the views but be aware that this might ruin the
ability to detach components.
