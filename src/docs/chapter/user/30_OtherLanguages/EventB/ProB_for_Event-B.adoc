= ProB for Event-B

In addition to classical B (aka B for software development), ProB also
supports Event-B and the Rodin platform. ProB can be installed as a
plugin for Rodin. Once installed, one can
<<tutorial-rodin-exporting,export contexts and models>> as *.eventb
files and use them within ProB Tcl/Tk and the command-line version
<<using-the-command-line-version-of-prob,probcli>>.

See the tutorial pages for more information about using ProB for
Event-B:
