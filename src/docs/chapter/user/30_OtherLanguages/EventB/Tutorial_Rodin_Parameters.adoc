Preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify the most important parameters of ProB by going to the
Rodin preferences.

Now selecting the ProB pane inside the Rodin preferences. You see that a
relatively large list of preferences appears (the actual number and
denotation depends on the exact version of ProB you have installed):

We explain the most important preferences below.

[[minint-and-maxint]]
Minint and Maxint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We first explain the first two entries in the screenshot above. Within
classical B this provides the range for the implementable integer type.
In Rodin, there are only the mathematical integers, and there is no
MININT or MAXINT constant. However, this preference will be used by ProB
if it cannot determine the value of an integer variable in order to know
in which range it should be enumerated.

[[size-of-unspecified-sets-carrier-sets]]
Size of unspecified sets (carrier sets)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the third entry in the screen shot above. ProB requires all
carrier sets to be finite and ProB has to know the cardinality before
starting the animation or model checking.

Some sets are explicitly enumerated, and thus finite. ProB will use this
to infer the correct cardinality.

For the other sets, ProB will try to chose a cardinality. If the axioms
of a context contain explicit predicates about the cardinality, such as
`card(S)=4`, then this value will be used. You can also use card(S) to
specify a maximum cardinality, or `card(S)>n` to specify a minimum
cardinality.

[[using-contexts-for-prob-animation]]
Using contexts for ProB animation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note that you can create a new context with those axioms just for
animation or model checking with ProB. For this you can simply
right-click on the context and use the Rodin command "EXTEND". For
example, in Camille syntax such a context could look like:

----
context c1_prob extends c1
axioms
@prob_axm card(S) = 3
end
----

After that you can also refine the model you want to animate by
right-clicking on it and using the Rodin command "REFINE", and then
add the new context to the seen context list:

`machine m0_prob refines m0  sees c0 c1_prob`

Here the machine m0_prob and c1_prob play the role of configuration
files for the animation. You can also add additional axioms in c1_prob
to force ProB to use a specific valuation of your constants.

If ProB cannot infer the size of a carrier set; it will use the default
value provided in the "Size of unspecified sets" preference.

Note that for complicated machines it can be tricky to set up the
cardinalities of the carrier sets correctly. For example, if you have an
axiom `f : A -\->> B`, then the cardinality of `A` must be greater or
equal to the cardinality of `B`. We are working on an automated analysis
for detecting the correct cardinalities of the carrier sets
automatically.
