= Alloy

As of version 1.8 ProB provides support to load
http://alloy.mit.edu/alloy/[Alloy] models. The Alloy models are
translated to B machines by a https://github.com/hhu-stups/alloy2b[Java
frontend].

This work and web page is still experimental.

The work is based on a translation of the specification language Alloy
to classical B. The translation allows us to load Alloy models into ProB
in order to find solutions to the model's constraints. The translation
is syntax-directed and closely follows the Alloy grammar. Each Alloy
construct is translated into a semantically equivalent component of the
B language. In addition to basic Alloy constructs, our approach supports
integers and orderings.

[[installation]]
== Installation

Alloy2B is included with the lastest nightly builds of ProB.

You can build it yourself:

* Clone or download https://github.com/hhu-stups/alloy2b[Alloy2B project
on Github].
* Make jar file (gradle build) and
* put resulting alloy2b-*.jar file into ProB's lib folder.

[[examples]]
== Examples

[[n-queens]]
=== N-Queens

....
module queens
open util/integer
sig queen { x:Int, x':Int, y:Int } {
    x >= 1
    y >= 1
    x <= #queen
    y <= #queen
    x' >=1
    x' <= #queen
    x' = minus[plus[#queen,1],x]
}
fact { all q:queen, q':(queen-q) {
    ! q.x = q'.x
    ! q.y = q'.y
    ! plus[q.x,q.y] = plus[q'.x,q'.y]
    ! plus[q.x',q.y] = plus[q'.x',q'.y]
}}
pred show {}
run show for exactly 4 queen, 5 int
....

This can be loaded in ProB, as shown in the following screenshot. To run
the "show" command you have to use "Find Sequence..." command for
"run_show" in the "Constraint-Based Checking" submenu of the
_Verify_ menu.

    v.src+v.dst = Object
    n in v.src

}
check add_preserves_inv for 3
....

Note that our translation does not (yet) generate an idiomatic B
encoding, with `move` as B operation
and `src+dst=Object` as invariant: it generates a check operation encoding the predicate
`add_preserves_inv` with universal quantification.

Below we shoe the B machine we have input into AtelierB. It was obtained
by pretty-printing from `\prob`, and putting the negated guard
of `theadd_preserves_inv` into an assertion (so that AtelierB generates the desired proof obligation).
