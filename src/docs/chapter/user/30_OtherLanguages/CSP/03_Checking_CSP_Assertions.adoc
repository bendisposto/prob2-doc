= Checking CSP Assertions

As of version 1.3.4, ProB provides support for refinement checking and
various other assertions (deadlock, divergence, determinism, and LTL/CTL
assertions) of CSP-M specifications. In this tutorial we give a short
overview of the ProB’s implementations and features for checking CSP
assertions. In the Tcl/Tk interface of ProB, CSP assertions can be
assembled and checked in the _CSP Assertions Viewer_. A description of
the _CSP Assertions Viewer_ is also given.

== Supported CSP Assertions in ProB

ProB provides support for checking almost all types of CSP-M assertions
that can be checked within FDR2. Besides the assertion types that can be
checked in FDR2, in ProB one also can check temporal properties on
processes expressed by means of LTL and CTL formulae.footnote:[ProB
provides support for LTL and CTL model checking (citations needed).] The
following types of assertions are supported in ProB:

*Refinement* +
Refinement is one of the fundamental notions for construction and
verification of systems specified in CSP. Given two CSP processes _P_
and _Q_ one can state in ProB the property that process _Q_ is an ‘m’
refinement of _P_ by the following assertion declaration:

`assert P [m= Q`

where ‘m’ indicates one of the following types of comparison: ‘T’ for
traces, ‘F’ for failures, ‘FD’ for failures-divergence, ‘R’ for
refusals, and ‘RD’ for ‘refusals-divergence’. Note that the refinement
types ‘V’ (revivals) and ‘VD’ (revivals-divergence) that are part of the
refinement assertions supported by FDR2 are yet not supported by ProB.

*Deadlock* +
Stating assertions about CSP processes to be deadlock-free is possible
by the following assertion declaration:

`assert P :[deadlock free [m]]`

where _P_ is a process expression and ‘m’ indicates one of the following
models: ‘F’ (failures) and ‘FD’ (failures-divergence).

*Determinism* +
Stating assertions about CSP processes to be deterministic is possible
by the following assertion declaration:

`assert P :[deterministic [m]]`

where _P_ is a process expression and ‘m’ one of the following models:
‘F’ (failures) and ‘FD’ (failures-divergence).

*Livelock* +
Stating assertions about CSP processes to be livelock-free is possible
by the following assertion declaration:

`assert P :[livelock free]`

where _P_ is a process expression.

*Temporal Properties* +
In ProB it is also possible to make assertions about temporal properties
of CSP processes both in LTL and CTL. Basically, one wants to check
whether some process _P_ satisfies a formula _f_ expressed in a temporal
logic (denoted by `P |= f`).

To check whether a process _P_ satisfies an LTL formula _f_ write the
following declaration:

`assert P |= LTL: “f”`

Note that _f_ must be placed between quotes and that the satisfaction
relation |= is immediately followed by `LTL:`. ProB supports LTL^[e]^,
an extended version of LTL which provides additionally support for
making propositions on transitions. The following LTL^[e]^ syntax for
CSP-M specifications can be outlined by the following rules:

* Atomic propositions:
** To check if an event `evt` is enabled in a state use `e(evt)`
* Transition propositions:
** To check whether an event `evt` is executed use `[evt]`
* Logical operators
** `true` and `false`
** `not`: negation
** `&`,`or` and `=>`: conjunction, disjunction and implication
* Temporal operators:
** `G f`: globally
** `F f`: finally
** `X f`: next
** `f U g`: until
** `f W g`: weak-until
** `f R g`: release
* Fairness operators:
** `WF(evt)` or `wf(evt)`: weak fairness, where `evt` is an event
** `SF(evt)` or `sf(evt)`: strong fairness, where `evt` is an event
** `WEF` and `SEF` for checking LTL^[e]^ formulae on executions that are
strongly and weakly fair with respect to all events, respectively

An LTL^[e]^ formula _f_ is satisfied by some CSP process _P_ if all
executions of _P_ satisfy _f_. If there is an execution of _P_ which
violates the property _f_, then the test `P |= f` fails by providing a
counterexample. Depending on whether _f_ expresses, a safety or liveness
property, a finite path or a path in a lasso-form (, i.e. a path leading
to a cycle) is returned as a counterexample, respectively.

Note that ProB supports also Past-LTL^[e]^. Past-LTL^[e]^, however, may
be considered to be inappropriate for LTL assertions since the goal of
this type of assertions is usually to check whether all executions
starting at the initial states of the process satisfy the respective
LTL^[e]^ formula.

To check whether a process _P_ satisfies a CTL formula _f_ the following
assertion should be made:

`assert P |= CTL: “f”`

As for LTL, CTL formulae should be put in between quotes. The CTL syntax
for CSP-M specifications could be summarised as follows:

* Atomic propositions:
** To check if an event `evt` is enabled in a state use `e(evt)`
* Transition propositions:
** To check whether an event `evt` is executed use `[evt]`
* State formulae, where f, f1 and f2 are path formulae:
** true | false | `not` f | f1 `&` f2 | f1 `or` f2 | f1 `=>` f2,
** E f : path quantifier `latexmath:[$\exists$]`, pronounced `for some
path`
** A f : path quantifier `latexmath:[$\forall$]`, pronounced `for all
paths`
* Path formulae, where g, g1 and g2 are state formulae:
** `X g`: next
** `g1 U g2`: until
** `G g`: globally
** `F g`: finally
* Next executed event:
** `EX [e] true`:

Note that these two types of assertions, the LTL and CTL assertions, are
not part of the CSP-M language supported by FDR2. Loading a CSP-M file
in FDR2 having assertion declarations of this form will exit with a
syntax error. Bear in mind to remove or comment out such LTL/CTL
assertions in the CSP-M file before loading it in FDR2.

[[csp-assertions-viewer]]
== CSP Assertions Viewer

When a CSP-M specification is loaded one can open the _CSP Assertion
Viewer_ either from the menu bar of the main window by selecting the
`Check CSP-M Assertions` command in the `Verify` menu or from the
Refinement button in the ‘’State Properties’’ pane. The viewer looks as
follows:

image::CSPAssertionsViewer.png[]

The _CSP Assertion Viewer_ of ProB has a similar design to the graphical
user interface of FDR2. It consists basically of three main components:
a menu bar, a list box and a tab pane. In the following each of the
components and their corresponding functionalities are thoroughly
described.

*The Menu Bar* +
The menu bar is placed at the top of the window. On OS X, it is placed
at the top of the screen. The menu bar includes several menus providing
commands for adjusting, executing and changing the items in the list
box, as well as some (standard) options for re-loading the model, saving
the items to an external file or the loaded file, and launching some
external tools related with the domain in which the list items are
checked. Each menu can be popped up by a click with Mouse-1 (usually the
left mouse button). The menu bar consists of the following menus and
menu commands:

* *File*
** _Reopen File_: Reopening (re-reading and re-loading) the currently
loaded file, incorporating any changes that may have been made since the
file was last loaded.
** _Copy new Assertions to File_: All assertions that have been added to
the list box since the currently loaded file was last read will be
written to the file, i.e. all assertions that are yet not in the file
are appended to it.
** _Save Assertions to External File_: Selecting the option opens a
standard Tk dialog box requesting a name of a file in which the
assertions and their results in the list box could be saved.
** _Exit_: Closing the CSP Assertion Viewer. Any assertion check results
and any recently added assertions from the Tab Pane will get lost. The
user will not be prompted to save these to the source file or an
external file.
* *Font* +
Changing the font settings of the elements in the list box. Each of the
items of this menu is a cascading menu that provides a number of options
to be selected. The currently selected option in the cascading menu is
marked by a tick symbol (✓).
** _Family-Name_: Change the font family of the text in the list box.
There are currently four font families that could be chosen: Arial,
Curier, Helvetica, and Times. Default font is Curier.
** _Size_: Change the font size of the text in the list box. Default
font size is 10.
** _Background_: Change the background color of the list box. Default
background color is Gray90.
* *Assertions* +
The menu provides a list of commands for checking different types of
assertions. In case a particular type of assertions is checked the
respective command checks only these assertions that are not checked
yet.
** _Uncheck All Assertions_: Set the status of all assertions in the
list box to non-checked (`?`).
** _Delete All Assertions_: Delete all assertions in the list box.
** _Check All Refinement…_: The item is a cascading menu and provides
commands to check all assertions of one of the following supported
refinement types: Traces, Failures, Failures-Divergence, Refusals, and
Refusals-Divergence.
** _Check Processes for…_: The item is a cascading menu and provides
commands to check all assertions of the following supported types of
checks: Deadlock, Determinism and Livelock.
** _Check All LTL Assertions_: Selecting this command causes ProB to
check all LTL assertions in the list box that are not checked yet.
** _Check All CTL Assertions_: Selecting this command causes ProB to
check all CTL assertions in the list box that are not checked yet.
** _Check All Assertions_: Selecting this command causes ProB to check
of all assertions in the list box that are not checked yet.
* *External Tools*
** _Open Specification with FDR_: Open the currently loaded CSP-M
specification in FDR2. The FDR2 tool is launched with the currently
loaded specification in case the FDR2 is installed and the correct path
to the `fdr2` command is set for the respective preference `Path to the
FDR2 tool`. The value of the`Path to the FDR2 tool` preference can be
changed from the “CSP Preferences…” window which can be opened by
selecting the `CSP Preferences…` command in `Preferences` menu of the
main window.
** _Evaluate with CSPM-Interpreter_: Selecting this command opens a
console in which one can evaluate CSP-M expressions using the CSP-M
interpreter. The CSP-M interpreter is an external tool implemented
independently from ProB. CSP-M expression can be evaluated if the `cspm`
tool is installed and the path to the cspm-command is set for the
respective preference `Path to CSPM tool`. The command is obsolete and
its removal is considered in future.

*The Assertion List Box* +
This part of the viewer lists all assertions stated in the currently
loaded CSP-M specification and provides a set of features for checking,
manipulating, and debugging of CSP assertions in the list. To each
statement in the assertion list box a symbol is assigned, placed on the
left side of it, that reveals the current status of the statement in the
viewer:

* ? - Assertion not checked yet.
* ✔ - Assertion check completed successfully.
* ✘ - Assertion check completed, but a counterexample was found to the
stated property. The debugger can be used to explore the reason why the
property does not hold.
* ⌚ - Assertion is currently checked.
* ! - The check of the assertion not completed for some reason. Possible
causes for the interruption may be:
** Syntax error in the property was detected;
** Assertion check failed because of missing implementation;
** Assertion check interrupted by user. +
 +
Note that in case of an LTL and a CTL assertion the check could fail to
complete because of a syntax error in the respective formula. If an
assertion check fails to complete an error box is popped up displaying
an error message, which indicates why the assertion check could not be
completed.

An assertion can be selected by clicking on it with Mouse-1 and checked
by double-clicking on it with Mouse-1. Alternatively, selecting an
assertion and then pressing the Enter key can start the respective
assertion check. When an assertion check is in progress, the assertion
will be marked by the clock symbol (⌚). If the assertion check is
completed without interrupting it, a new status is assigned to the
assertion: tick symbol (✔) indicating that the assertion was completed
successfully or cross symbol (✘) indicating that a counterexample was
found for the stated property. In case that the status is cross the
counterexample can be explored by (second) double-click with Mouse-1 on
the assertion or by selecting the assertion and then pressing the Enter
key. If the respective assertion is negated, i.e. there is `not` in
front of the assertion property, and marked with a cross, then no
counterexample can be explored as the proper statement holds.

The list box is equipped with a contextual menu (or a pop-up menu),
which appears when you right-click on an assertion in the list.
Depending on the type and the status of the assertion the contextual
menu provides options for checking, debugging, modifying the respective
assertion, as well as various other options. Take, for example, the
selected assertion on which the contextual menu is popped up in the
picture below.

image::CSPAssertionsViewer_ctxmenu.png[]

The assertion "`ASSYSTEM |= LTL: “GF [eats.0]”`" intends to check if
the process ASSYSTEM satisfies the LTL formula "`GF [eats.0]`". For
the selected assertion above, for example, the options `Show LTL
Counterexample`and`Show LTL Counterexample in State Space` are enabled
as a counterexample was found for the check. On the other hand, the
options `Check Assertion` and `Interrupt Assertion` are disabled as the
assertion check was completed.

The contextual menu has in general the following options:

The following options affect only the assertion being selected.

* *Debug or Show LTL/CTL Counterexample…*: Opens the graphical viewer
for exploring the counterexample that was found for the respective LTL
assertion check. Option is enabled if the assertion is not negated and
its status is cross (✘), or if the assertion is negated and its status
is tick (✔). Option appears if the assertion type is an LTL assertion or
a CTL assertion.
* *Debug Assertion*: Opens a trace-failure debugger window showing the
reason why the corresponding assertion check failed. Option is enabled
if the assertion is not negated and its status is cross (✘), or if the
assertion is negated and its status is tick (✔). Option available for
all types of assertions except for LTL and CTL assertions.
* *Check Assertion*: Starts immediately the check of the assertion being
selected before right clicking on it.
* *Interrupt Assertion Check*: Interrupts the current assertion check.
* *Uncheck Assertion*: If the assertion was checked and the result of
the check is different from question mark (?), then the status of the
assertion will be reset to question mark. Option is enabled only if the
assertion result is different from question mark.
* *Delete Assertion*: Removes the selected item from the assertion list.
* *Negate Assertion*: Negates the respective assertion. If the result of
the (proper) assertion check is cross (✘), then the result of the
negated assertion becomes tick (✔). Otherwise, if the result of the
(proper) assertion is tick (✔), the negated assertion becomes cross (✘).
* *Swap Processes*: Option available only for refinement assertions.
Performing the command causes the attachment of a new refinement
assertion in which the process expressions on both sides of the
refinement operator `[m=` are swapped. If, for example, we execute
‘’Swap Processes’’ on the assertion "`P [T= Q`", the command adds to
the list of assertions the assertion "`Q [T= P`".

The following options affect all assertions in the list box.

* *Check All Assertions*: The command causes the check of all assertions
in the list box. The assertions that are already checked would not be
checked again.
* *Uncheck All Assertions*: The status of all assertions in the list box
is reset to question mark.
* *Delete All Assertions*: All entries in the list box are removed. As a
result the message “No assertions were added.” appears in the list box.

Other options. The following options have no impact on the assertions in
the list box.

* *Summary of the CSP Syntax*: Opens a window in which the summary of
the CSP-M syntax and features supported by the ProB tool is given.
* *Evaluate CSP Expressions*: Opens the Eval console in which CSP
expressions can be evaluated.
* *Open Specification with FDR*: Opens the currently loaded CSP-M
specification in FDR2. The FDR2 tool is launched with the currently
loaded specification if FDR2 is installed and the correct path to the
`fdr2` command is set for the respective preference `Path to the FDR2
tool`. The value of the`Path to the FDR2 tool` preference can be
changed from the “CSP Preferences…” window which can be opened by
selecting the `CSP Preferences…` command in `Preferences` menu of the
main window.

*The Tab Pane* +
The tab pane is placed at the bottom of the window and enables the user
to construct and check properties of processes of the currently loaded
CSP-M file without adding explicitly assertions to the file.

There are overall six tab pages. Each tab page is used to build up new
assertion statements. The tab pages provide selectors, entries and
command buttons for assembling, adding and checking new assertions. In
each of the selectors all possible processes of the loaded CSP-M file
are accessible. It is also possible to specify new process expressions
by entering these in the respective entry of the process selector. The
tab pages for creating LTL and CTL assertions provide additionally an
appropriate entry for specifying the according LTL and CTL formula
intended to be checked on the specified process, respectively.

Each tab page is equipped with the following command buttons:

* *Add*: Attaching a new assertion to the list of assertions in the list
box. If the entry in one of the selectors is empty no assertion will be
added to list box and a warning message will appear informing the user
that some of the entries were not specified. If the entered assertion in
the tab page is already in the list box, then a warning box appears
informing the user that the assertion is already in the list box. If the
assertion is present in the list box it will not be added.
* *Check*: Attaching a new assertion to the list of assertions in the
list box and immediately starting checking the assertion. If the
assertion is already in the list box, then the user will be informed
that the assertion is already in the list box and in case it is not
checked yet its check will be started.
* *Cancel/Interrupt*: Closes the window or interrupts an assertion
check. In case the “Cancel” command is executed all checks and new
assertions will get lost. If an assertion is currently checked, then the
button command “Cancel” is replaced by another button command
‘’Interrupt’’, which causes the interruption of the current assertion
check when the button is clicked on.

[[debugging-non-satisfied-assertions]]
== Debugging Non-satisfied Assertions

In case an assertion check has failed the user can explore the reason
for the assertion violation. If the corresponding assertion is not
negated and after finishing the assertion check is marked by cross, then
this is an indication that ProB has found a counterexample for the
check. The counterexample can be explored by a second double-click with
the ‘Mouse-1’ button or by selecting the assertion and then pressing the
‘Enter’ button. Depending on the type of the assertion and the type of
the counterexample a corresponding debugging window is opened.

If a CSP process violates an LTL formula or a universally quantified CTL
formula, then by performing a second double-click on the respective
assertion one can explore the provided counterexample by means of the
graphical viewer (http://stups.hhu.de/ProB/w/Graphical_Viewer[Graphical
Viewer]).

In the following we give an overview of the features for debugging
counterexamples being found for different refinement checks. Consider
the following CSP processes:

P = a -> b -> c -> STOP

Q = a -> (b -> Q [] c -> Q)

R = a -> b -> R

If we intend to check whether P is deadlock free, then we can state the
assertion

`assert P :[deadlock free [F]]`.

The check of the assertion will finish by marking the assertion in the
list box with a cross symbol (✘). The cross symbol indicates that a
counterexample was found for the assertion check. The counterexample is
basically given by the trace latexmath:[$\langle a,b,c \rangle$] as
obviously `P` reaches a deadlock state after performing the trace
latexmath:[$\langle a,b,c \rangle$]. Providing a second double-click on
the assertion will open the following debugging window:

image::CSP_Deadlock_Trace.png[]

Considering the CSP processes `Q` and `R` one can see or check that `R`
is a trace refinement of `Q` since `R` performs the same set of traces
as `Q`. Thus, the assertion check for `Q [T= R` will mark the assertion
statement in the list box by a tick symbol (✔). On the other hand,
checking the assertion `R [T= Q` will find a counterexample for the
refinement check. Performing a second double-click on the item `R [T= Q`
will open the following trace debugger window with the counterexample
displayed in it:

image::CSP_Trace_Debugger.png[]

A counterexample of a trace-refinement assertion is a trace leading to a
state in which the implementation process performs an event that the
specification process cannot perform. In the example above both
processes `P` and `Q` perform the trace latexmath:[$\langle a \rangle$]
and reach states in which the implementation process can perform an
event that is not offered by the specification process _R_. One can
easily deduce from the picture above that `Q` performs after `a` the
event `c` which is not offered by `R` as `R` can perform only `b` after
`a`. In the left most column `Accept` the debugger window lists all
possible events that are offered by the specification process after
performing the trace given in the `Trace` column next to `Accepts`.

As we already mentioned above `R` is a trace-refinement of `Q`. On the
other hand, checking whether `R` is a failures-refinement of `Q` will
produce a counterexample since `R` refuses the event `c` that is offered
by Q after executing `a`. Accordingly, the counterexample will be
illustrated within the following trace debugger window:

image::CSP_Failures_Debugger.png[]

These are basically the three types of debugging windows that will
appear when debugging a counterexample for an assertion check in case
the respective assertion is not an LTL or a CTL assertion. When a
counterexample for an LTL assertion is found it will be explored in the
graphical viewer, the same graphical viewer that is used for visualizing
the state space models in ProB.

Let us observe again the CSP process `Q` and suppose we want to check
whether `Q` satisfies the LTL formula `F [c]`. Then, the respective LTL
assertion is declared as follows:

`assert Q |= LTL: “F [c]”`

The assertion check will produce a counterexample as `Q` obviously
reaches a cycle “(b -> a)+” that violates the property “F [c]”.
Performing a second double-click on the assertion will display the
following state space graph in the graphical viewer:

image::CE_LTL_assertion.png[]

In the figure above, the nodes and the transitions of the respective
counterexample "a -> (b -> a)+" are colored in red.

[[checking-csp-assertions-with-probcli]]
== Checking CSP Assertions with `probcli`

It is also possible to check CSP assertions with the command line
version of ProB. The command has the following syntax:

`probcli -csp_assertion "A"File`

where _A_ is a CSP assertion and _File_ the path to the CSP file. For
example, if we want to check the refinement assertion `P [T= Q` on
some CSP specification `example.csp`, then we can do this by running the
ProB command line version with the following options:

`probcli -csp_assertion "P [T=Q"example.csp`

Note that the assertion should be placed between quotes. In addition,
when an assertion is checked with the '-csp_assertion' option the
keyword *assert* should be omitted.

Notice that for checking LTL and CTL assertions from the command line
you need to escape the double quotes (") wrapping the respective LTL/CTL
formula by means of a backslash \.

`probcli -csp_assertion "Q |= LTL: \"F [c]\"" example.csp`
