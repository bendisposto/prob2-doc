[[startup]]
== Startup

Start off by installing the standalone Tcl/Tk version of ProB. Follow
the instructions in <<installation,Installation>>. Start ProB by
double-clicking on `ProBWin` (for Windows users), or by launching
`StartProB.sh` from a Terminal (for Linux and Mac users).

[[loading-a-first-csp-specification]]
== Loading a first CSP specification

Use the "Open..." command in the _File_ menu and then navigate to
the "Examples" directory that came with your ProB installation. Inside
the "CSP" subfolder, open the "buses.csp" specification. Your main
ProB window should now look as follows:

[[first-steps-in-animation]]
== First Steps in Animation

We have now loaded a first simple CSP model. Let us look at the contents
of the ProB window (ignoring the menu bar).

* The upper half of the ProB window contains the source code of the CSP
specification.
* The lower half contains three panes.
** The "State Properties" pane contains information about the current
state of the specification. We will explain the contents of this pane in
more detail later.
** The Pane called "Enabled Operations" contains a list of events that
your CSP specification offers. At the very first step you have to choose
a process to animate. If your CSP specification contains a MAIN process
(as is the case in buses.csp), only this process will be shown.
** The "History" pane contains the list of operations you have
executed to reach the current state of the animator. Obviously, this
list is initially empty.

Now, double click on "`MAIN`" process in the "Enabled Operations"
Pane. This has the effect of computing the events offered by `MAIN`. The
ProB window should now look as follows (the upper half will remain
unchanged):

In the "Enabled Operations" pane we can see that two tau events are
offered: `tau(int_choice_left)` and `tau(int_choice_right)`. The
"History" pane shows us that we have started the "`MAIN`" process to
reach the current state. By single-clicking on an event, we can see
which parts of the CSP specification contributed to the event. For
example, single clicking on the first tau event yields in the following
picture:

image::ProB_CSPAfterTauSingleClick.png[]

By repeatedly single clicking on the event you can cycle through the
various locations that contributed to the event. To execute an event,
simply double-click on it. Try this out for yourself: double-click on
`tau(int_choice_left)` and then single-click on the `board37` event
which is offered. This time the event is a synchronization of two
events(note that ProB uses a different colour for highlighting the
source locations). The source highlighting should look as follows:

[[first-steps-in-model-checking]]
== First Steps in Model Checking

You can use the model checker to search for certain errors. Execute the
"Model Check..." command in the _Verify_ menu. The following dialog
box will appear:

image::ProB_CSPModelCheck.png[]

By default, ProB will search for deadlocks, illegal channel values and
events on the "error" channel. To turn the latter off, uncheck the
"Find Invariant Violation" check box. You can also search for events
on the "goal"channel, by checking the corresponding check box ("Find
event on goal CSP channel").

Now press the "Model Check" button. ProB should find a deadlock and
insert the counter-example into the history as follows:

[[error-highlighting]]
== Error Highlighting

Now edit the definition of the BUS37 process and add an illegal output
of value 1 on the alight37B channel:

`BUS37 = board37A -> (pay90 -> alight37B!1 -> STOP` +
`[] alight37A -> STOP)`

Now save and reload the specification and again choose the "Model
Check..." command in the _Verify_ menu. Now uncheck the "Find
Deadlocks" check-box and press "Model Check". ProB will report the
following error:

----
Mismatch in number of arguments for synchronisation on channel alight37B with extra argument(s):
1
  ### Line: 11, Column: 30
----

display the trace to the error in the History pane and highlight the
error location in the source as follows:

[[other-features]]
== Other Features

You can check more sophisticated temporal properties using the LTL model
checker of ProB; see the link:/LTL_Model_Checking[corresponding part of
the tutorial]. For example, you can try and validate the following LTL
formula `G([board37A] \=> F [alight37B])`. ProB should respond:
`Formula TRUE. No counterexample found.` Similarly, you can check the
absence of divergence by checking the LTL formula `G not G [tau]`. It is
also possible to perform various refinement checks and other assertion
checks (see http://stups.hhu.de/ProB/w/Checking_CSP_Assertions[Checking
CSP Assertions' tutorial]). The state space visualization features of
ProB are also available for CSP; see link:/State_Space_Visualization[the
corresponding part of the tutorial]. For example, if you select the
command "Statespace" in the _Visualize_ menu (after having fully
explored the system), the following graph will be displayed:
