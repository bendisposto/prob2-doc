Summary of B Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[logical-predicates]]
Logical predicates:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

....
 P & Q       conjunction
 P or Q      disjunction
 P => Q      implication
 P <=> Q     equivalence
 not P       negation
 !(x).(P=>Q) universal quantification
 #(x).(P&Q)  existential quantification
....

Above, `P` and `Q` stand for predicates. Inside the universal
quantification, `P` must give a value type to the quantified variable.
Note: you can also introduce multiple variables inside a universal or
existential quantification, e.g., `!(x,y).(P => Q)`.

[[equality]]
Equality:
^^^^^^^^^

....
 E = F      equality
 E /= F     disequality
....

[[booleans]]
Booleans:
^^^^^^^^^

....
 TRUE
 FALSE
 BOOL        set of boolean values ({TRUE,FALSE})
 bool(P)     convert predicate into BOOL value
....

Warning: `TRUE` and `FALSE` are values and not predicates in B and
cannot be combined using logical connectives. To combine two boolean
values `x` and `y` using conjunction you have to write
`x=TRUE & y=TRUE`. To convert a predicate such as `z>0` into a boolean
value you have to use `bool(z>0)`.

....

[[strings]]
Strings:
^^^^^^^^

....
  "astring"     a specific (single-line) string value
  '''astring''' an alternate way of writing (multi-line) strings, no need to escape "
  STRING        the set of all strings
                Note: for the moment enumeration of strings is limited (if a variable
                of type STRING is not given a value by the machine, then ProB assumes
                STRING = { "STR1", "STR2" })
....

Atelier-B does not support any operations on strings, apart from
equality and disequality. However, the ProB
link:/External_Functions[external function library] contains several
operators on strings. ProB also allows multi-line strings. As of version
1.7.0, ProB will support the following escape sequences within strings:

`\n   newline (ASCII character 13)` +
`\r   carriage return (ASCII 10)` +
`\t  tab (ASCII 9)` +
`\"   the double quote symbol "` +
`\'   the single quote symbol '` +
`\\   the backslash symbol`

Within single-line string literals, you do not need to escape '. Within
multi-line string literals, you do not need to escape " and you can use
tabs and newlines. ProB assumes that all B machines and strings use the
UTF-8 encoding.

[[trees]]
Trees:
^^^^^^

Nodes in the tree are denoted by index sequences (branches), e.g,
n=[1,2,1] Each node in the tree is labelled with an element from a
domain S A tree is a function mapping of branches to elements of the
domain S.

....
  tree(S)      set of trees over domain S
  btree(S)     set of binary trees over domain S
  top(t)       top of a tree
  const(E,s)   construct a tree from info E and sequence of subtrees s
  rank(t,n)    rank of the node at end of branch n in the tree t
  father(t,n)  father of the node denoted by branch n in the tree t
  son(t,n,i)   the ith son of the node denoted by branch n in tree t
  sons(t)      the sequence of sons of the root of the tree t
  subtree(t,n)

  sizet(t)     the size of the tree (number of nodes)
  prefix(t)    the nodes of the tree t in prefix order
  postfix(t)    the nodes of the tree t in prefix order
  mirror, infix are recognised by the parser but not yet supported by ProB itself
....

[[let-and-if-then-else]]
LET and IF-THEN-ELSE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ProB allows the following for predicates and expressions:

....
   IF P THEN E1 ELSE E2 END              conditional for expressions or predicates E1,E2
   LET x1,... BE x1=E1 & ... IN E END
....

Note: the expressions E1,... defining x1,... are not allowed to use
x1,...

[[statements-aka-substitutions]]
Statements (aka Substitutions):
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

....
  skip         no operation
  x := E       assignment
  f(x) := E    functional override
  x :: S       choice from set
  x : (P)      choice by predicate P (constraining x)
  x <-- OP(x)  call operation and assign return value
  G||H         parallel substitution**
  G;H          sequential composition**
  ANY x,... WHERE P THEN G END   non deterministic choice
  LET x,... BE x=E & ... IN G END
  VAR x,... IN G END             generate local variables
  PRE P THEN G END
  ASSERT P THEN G END
  CHOICE G OR H END
  IF P THEN G END
  IF P THEN G ELSE H END
  IF P1 THEN G1 ELSIF P2 THEN G2 ... END
  IF P1 THEN G1 ELSIF P2 THEN G2 ... ELSE Gn END
  SELECT P THEN G WHEN ... WHEN Q THEN H END
  SELECT P THEN G WHEN ... WHEN Q THEN H ELSE I END
  CASE E OF EITHER m THEN G OR n THEN H ... END END
  CASE E OF EITHER m THEN G OR n THEN H ... ELSE I END END

  WHEN P THEN G END  is a synonym for SELECT P THEN G END

**: cannot be used at the top-level of an operation, but needs to
  be wrapped inside a BEGIN END or another statement (to avoid
  problems with the operators ; and ||).
....

[[machine-header]]
Machine header:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

....
  MACHINE or REFINEMENT or IMPLEMENTATION

  Note: machine parameters can either be SETS (if identifier is all upper-case)
        or scalars (i.e., integer, boolean or SET element; if identifier is not
        all upper-case; typing must be provided be CONSTRAINTS)
  You can also use MODEL or SYSTEM as a synonym for MACHINE, as well
  as EVENTS as a synonym for OPERATIONS.
....

  Note:
  Refinement machines should express the operation preconditions in terms
  of their own variables.
....

Definitions:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

....
  NAME1 == Expression;          Definition without arguments
  NAME2(ID,...,ID) == E2;       Definition with arguments
....

` ````FILE.def`''`;                   Include definitions from file`

There are a few Definitions which can be used to influence the animator:

....
  GOAL == P                to define a custom Goal predicate for Model Checking
                        (the Goal is also set by using "Advanced Find...")

  ANIMATION_STRn == "sometext"       a string without spaces
....

[[comments-and-pragmas]]
Comments and Pragmas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

....
B supports two styles of comments:
   /* ... */       block comments
   // ...          line comments
....

....
ProB recognises several pragma comments of the form /*@ PRAGMA VALUE */
The whitespace between @ and PRAGMA is optional.
  /*@symbolic */      put before comprehension set or lambda to instruct ProB
                      to keep it symbolic and not try to compute it explicitly
  /*@label LBL */     associates a label LBL with the following predicate
                      (LBL must be identifier or a string "....")
  /*@desc DESC */     associates a description DESC with the preceding predicate
  /*@file PATH */     associates a file for machines in SEES, INCLUDES, ...
                      put pragma after a seen or included machine
  /*@package NAME */  at start of machine, machine file should be in folder NAME/...
                      NAME can be qualified N1.N2...Nk, in which case the machine
                      file should be in N1/N2/.../Nk
  /*@import-package NAME */  adds ../NAME to search paths for SEES,...
                      NAME can also be qualified N1.N2...Nk, use after package pragma
  /*@unit U */        associates a unit U with the following constant or variable in the
                      CONSTANTS or VARIABLES section, possible units are, e.g.,
                      "m", "s", "mps", "m * s**-2"  (quotes must be used);
                      see https://www3.hhu.de/stups/prob/index.php/Tutorial_Unit_Plugin

....

[[differences-with-atelierbb4free]]
Differences with AtelierB/B4Free
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basically, ProB tries to be compatible with Atelier B and conforms to
the semantics of Abrial's B-Book and of
http://www.atelierb.eu/php/documents-en.php#manuel-reference[Atelier B's
reference manual]. Here are the main differences with Atelier B:

....
  - tuples without parentheses are not supported; write (a,b,c) instead of a,b,c
  - relational composition has to be wrapped into parentheses; write (f;g)
  - parallel product also has to be wrapped into parentheses; write (f||g)
  - trees are not yet fully supported
  - the VALUES clause is only partially supported
  - definitions have to be syntactically correct and be either an expression,
    predicate or substitution;
    the arguments to definitions have to be expressions;
    definitions which are predicates or substitutions must be declared before first use
  - definitions are local to a machine
  - for ProB the order of fields in a record is not relevant (internally the fields are
    sorted), Atelier-B reports a type error if the order of the name of the fields changes
  - well-definedness: for disjunctions and implications ProB uses the L-system
    of well-definedness (i.e., for P => Q, P should be well-defined and
    if P is true then Q should also be well-defined)
  - ProB allows WHILE loops and sequential composition in abstract machines
  - ProB now allows the IF-THEN-ELSE and LET for expressions and predicates
    (e.g., IF x<0 THEN -x ELSE x END or LET x BE x=f(y) IN x+x END)
  - ProB's type inference is stronger than Atelier-B's, much less typing predicates
    are required
  - ProB accepts operations with parameters but without pre-conditions
  - ProB allows identifiers consisting of a single character
  - ProB allows multi-line strings and supports UTF-8 characters in strings,
    and ProB allows string literals written using three apostrophes ('''string''')
  - ProB allows a she-bang line in machine files starting with #!
 (If you discover more differences, please let us know!)
....

See also our Wiki for documentation:

* http://www.stups.hhu.de/ProB/index.php5/Current_Limitations
* http://www.stups.hhu.de/ProB/index.php5/Using_ProB_with_Atelier_B

Also note that there are various differences between BToolkit and
AtelierB/ProB:

....
 - AtelierB/ProB do not allow true as predicate;
   e.g., PRE true THEN ... END is not allowed (use BEGIN ... END instead)
 - AtelierB/ProB do not allow a machine parameter to be used in the PROPERTIES
 - AtelierB/ProB require a scalar machine parameter to be typed in the
   CONSTRAINTS clause
 - In AtelierB/ProB the BOOL type is pre-defined and cannot be redefined
....

[[other-notes]]
Other notes
^^^^^^^^^^^

....
 ProB is best at treating universally quantified formulas of the form
 !x.(x:SET => RHS), or
 !(x,y).(x|->y:SET =>RHS), !(x,y,z).(x|->y|->z:SET =>RHS), ...;
 otherwise the treatment of !(x1,...,xn).(LHS => RHS) may delay until all values
 treated by LHS are known.
 Similarly, expressions of the form SIGMA(x).(x:SET|Expr) and PI(x).(x:SET|Expr)
 lead to better constraint propagation.
 The construction S:FIN(S) is recognised by ProB as equivalent to the Event-B
 finite(S) operator.
ProB assumes that machines and STRING values are encoded using UTF-8.
