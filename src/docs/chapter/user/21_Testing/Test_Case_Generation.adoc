Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Testing aims at finding errors in a system or program. A set of tests is
also called a test suite. Test case generation is the process of
generating test suites for a particular system. Model-based Testing
(MBT) is a technique to generate test suites for a system from a model
describing the system. One usually tries to generate test suite which
satisfies a given coverage criterion, e.g., ensuring that parts of the
model are exhaustively exercised. Indeed, exhaustive testing of the
implemented system is usually infeasible (because it would require
infinitely many or way too many test cases), but one would like to
increase the likelihood that the selected test suite uncovers errors in
the implemented system.

In our case we have that

* a model is a formal model written in B, Event-B or even TLA+ and Z
* a test-case is a sequence of operations (or events) along with
parameter values for the operations and concrete values for the
constants and initial values of the formal model. One can also specify
that a valid test case must end in a given class of states (specified by
a predicate on the formal model's state).
* the coverage criterion is currently restricted to operation/event
coverage, i.e., trying to ensure that every operation/event of the model
is exercised by at least one test case.

ProB has two main algorithms to find suites of test cases:

* model-checking-based (invoked, e.g., using the
<<Using_the_Command-Line_Version_of_ProB#-mcm_tests,mcm_tests>>
command of <<Using_the_Command-Line_Version_of_ProB,probcli>>) and
* constraint-based (invoked, e.g., using the <<Using_the_Command-Line_Version_of_ProB#-cbc_tests,cbc_tests>> 
command of <<Using_the_Command-Line_Version_of_ProB,probcli>>; more
details can be found below)

The former will run the model checker to generate the state space of the
formal model, and will stop when the coverage criterion has been
satisfied. The full state space of the model contains all possible
initialisations of the machine, along with all possible values of the
constants. The latter will use
B's constraint solver to generate
feasible sequences of events in a breadth-first fashion and will also
stop when the coverage criterion has been satisfied. (You may want to
examine the
<<tutorial-model-checking-proof-and-cbc,Tutorial_Model_Checking,_Proof_and_CBC>>
in this context.) So, what are the differences:

* the constraint-based approach will instantiate the constants and
parameters of the operations as required by the target sequence. It will
not examine every possible valuation for the constants and initial
values of the machine, nor every possible value for the parameters of
the operation.
* the constraint-based approach hence does not construct the full-state
space (aka a graph), but rather constructs a tree of feasible execution
paths. The constraint-based approach cannot detect cycles; even if the
state space is finite it may run forever in case an operation cannot be
covered (because it is infeasible).

[[model-checking-based-test-case-generation]]
=== Model-Checking-Based Test Case Generation

Model-checking-based test case generation will build the model's state space, starting from the initial states, until the coverage criterion is satisfied. ProB uses a "breadth-first" approach to search for the test cases.

==== How to run

We will use the following B Machine as an example, which is stored in a
file called `simplecounter.mch`.

....
MACHINE SimpleCounter
DEFINITIONS MAX==4
VARIABLES count
INVARIANT
 count: 1..MAX
INITIALISATION count := 1
OPERATIONS
  Increase(y) = PRE y: 1..(MAX-count) THEN
     count := count+y
  END;
  Reset = BEGIN count := 1 END
END
....

To start the test case generation there are two alternatives: Using the tcl/tk-application or the command line.

====== From the command line

From the command line there are two commands to configure the
test case generation:

....
-mcm_tests Depth MaxStates EndPredicate File
        generate test cases with maximum length Depth, exploring MaxStates
        states; the last state satisfies EndPredicate and the
        test cases are written to File

-mcm_cover Operation(s)
        Specify an operation or event that should be covered when generating
        test cases. Multiple operations/events can be specified by seperating
        them by comma or by using -mcm_cover several times.
....

When all requested operations are covered by test cases within maximum length `Depth`, the algorithm will still explore the complete state space up to that maximum distance `Depth` from the initialisation. It outputs all found traces that satisfy the given requirements. The algorithm stops when it either

* has covered all required operations/events with(/and?) the current search depth
* or has reached the maximum search depth or maximum number of states to explore.

*Example:* To generate test cases that cover the event `Increase` in the
machine above, leading to a state where `count = MAX-1` is true, the
explored paths do not have a depth of more than 5 operations and not more than 2000 states are explored, we would specify this as follows, where we have a timeout of 2000
ms for each explored trace:

....
./probcli.sh simplecounter.mch -mcm_tests 5 2000 count=MAX-1 test_results.xml -mcm_cover Increase
....

The generated test cases are stored in a file called `test_results.xml`.
You can provide the empty filename

....
''
....

in which case no file is generated. Providing the same as `EndPredicate` will only lead to test cases of length 1.

As of version 1.6.0, the operation arguments are also written to the XML
file. The preference `INTERNAL_ARGUMENT_PREFIX` can be used to provide a
prefix for internal operation arguments; any argument/parameter whose
name starts with that prefix is considered an internal parameter and not
shown in the trace file. Also, as of version 1.6.0, the
non-deterministic initialisations are shown in the XML trace file: all
variables and constants where more than one possible initialisation
exists are written into the trace file, as argument of an INITIALISATION
event.

====== In the tcl/tk-application

In the tcl/tk-application the test case generation can be started by choosing _Analyse > Testing > model-checking-based test case generation..._. In the appearing window one can set the same parameters as described for the command line.

image::MBT-MCM-Dialog-SC.png[]

After a short while you will see the following window:

image::MBT-MCM-Result-SC.png[]

You cannot look at the test cases in ProB. Instead you can open the file you just saved the results to, which looks like this:

....
<extended_test_suite>
  <test_case id="1" targets="[Increase]">
    <global>
      <step id="1" name="Increase">
      <value name="y">4</value>
    </step>
    </global>
  </test_case>
</extended_test_suite>
....

[[constraint-based-test-case-generation]]
=== Constraint-Based Test Case Generation

Constraint based test case generation allows to explore the state space
for a machine and generate traces of operations that cover certain user
defined operations and meet a given condition to end the search. (See
also the <<bounded-model-checking,bounded model checker>> of ProB
which uses this technique to find invariant violations.)

When should one use the constraint-based test case generator:

* when one has a large number of possible values for the constants
* when one has a large number of possible values for the initial values
* when one has a large number of possible values for the parameters of
the operations
* when the length of the individual test-cases remains relatively low;
indeed, the complexity of the constraint solving increases with the
length of the test-case and the number of candidate test cases also
typically grows exponentially with the depth of the feasible execution
paths.

[[example-when-constraint-based-test-case-generation-is-better]]
==== Example: When Constraint-based Test Case Generation is better

Here is an example which illustrates when constraint-based test case
generation is better.

....
MACHINE Wiki_Example1
CONSTANTS n PROPERTIES n:NATURAL1
VARIABLES x, y INVARIANT x: 0..n & y:0..n
INITIALISATION x :: 1..n || y := 0
OPERATIONS
  Sety(yy) = PRE yy:1..n THEN y:=yy END;
  BothOverflow = SELECT x=y & y> 255 THEN x,y := 0,0 END
END
....

The state space of this machine is infinite, as we have infinitely many
possible values for n. For large values of n, we also have many possible
initialisations for x and many possible parameter values for the `Sety`
operation. This gives us an indication that the constraint-based
test-case generation algorithm is better suited. Indeed, it will very
quickly generate two test cases:

* SETUP_CONSTANTS(1) ; INITIALISATION(1,0) ; Sety(1)
* SETUP_CONSTANTS(256) ; INITIALISATION(256,0) ; Sety(256) ;
BothOverflow

For the second test, the constraint solver was asked to find values for
n, x, y, and the parameter yy so that the following sequence is
feasible:

* SETUP_CONSTANTS(n) ; INITIALISATION(x,y) ; Sety(yy) ; BothOverflow

The first solution it found was n=256,x=256,y=0,yy=256. The whole
test-case generation process takes less than a second. The generated
tree can be visualised by ProB:

image::CBC_Test_Tree_Example1.png[center||500px]
One can see that the
only path of length 1 (not counting the INITIALISATION step) consists of
the operation Set. The possible paths of length 2 are Set;BothOverflow
and Set;Set. (The latter is grayed out as it does not provide a new test
case.) Within ProB's state space the following states are generated by
the test case generator. As one can see only the values n=1 and n=256
were generated, as driven by ProB's constraint solver:

image::CBC_Test_Tree_States_Example1.png[center||250px]

Finding a trace such that BothOverflow is enabled using the model
checker will take much more time. Indeed, first one has to set `MAXINT`
to at least 256 so that the value n=256 will eventually be generated.
Then one has to set `MAX_INITIALISATIONS` also to at least 256 so that
this value will actually be inspected by the model checker. Finally one
has to set `MAX_OPERATIONS` also to at least 256 to generate yy=256;
leading to a (truncated) state space of at least 16,777,216 states.
Below is the state space just for the values n=1 and n=2 (which contains
no state where BothOverflow is enabled):

[[how-to-run]]
==== How to run

We will again use the machine `simplecounter.mch`. To start the test case generation there are three alternatives: Using the tcl/tk-application or using the command line by either providing all settings as command line arguments or in a test description file.


====== From the command line

From the command line there are six relevant settings to configure the
test case generation:

....
-cbc_tests Depth EndPredicate File
        generate test cases by constraint solving with maximum
        length Depth; the last state satisfies EndPredicate
        and the test cases are written to File

-cbc_cover Operation
        when generating CBC test cases, Operation should be covered. Each
        operation to be covered needs to be specified separately.

-cbc_cover_match PartialOpName
        just like -cbc_cover but for all operations whose name contains "PartialOpName"

-cbc_cover_final
        specifies that the events specified above should only be used as final events in test-cases.
        This option can lead to a considerable reduction in running time of the algorithm.

-p CLPFD TRUE
        flag to enable the CLPFD constraint solver to search the state space, which is highly recommended.

-p TIME_OUT x
        time out in milliseconds to abort the exploration of each possible trace
....

*Example:* To generate test cases that cover the event `Increase` in the
machine above, leading to a state where `count = MAX-1` is true and the
explored paths do not have a depth of more than 5 operations, we would
specify this as follows, where we use CLPFD and have a timeout of 2000
ms for each explored trace:

....
./probcli.sh simplecounter.mch -cbc_tests 5 count=MAX-1 test_results.xml -cbc_cover Increase -p CLPFD true -p TIME_OUT 2000
....

The generated test cases are stored in a file called `test_results.xml`.
Just as with model-checking-based test case generation you can provide the empty filename `''`, in which case no file is generated, and an empty `EndPredicate` that will only lead to test cases of length 1.

[[with-a-test-description-file]]
====== With a test description file

The configuration for the test case generation can also be provided as
an XML file. The format is shown below:

....
<test-generation-description>
  <output-file>OUTPUT FILE NAME</output-file>
  <event-coverage>
    <event>EVENT 1</event>
    <event>EVENT 2</event>
  </event-coverage>
  <target>TARGET PREDICATE</target>
  <!-- the parameters section contains parameters that are very ProB-specific -->
  <parameters>
    <!-- the maximum depth is the maximum length of a trace of operations/event,
         the algorithm might stop earlier when all events are covered -->
    <maximum-depth>N</maximum-depth>
    <!-- any ProB preference can be set that is listed when calling "probcli -help -v" -->
    <!-- other probably interesting preferences are MININT, MAXINT and TIME_OUT -->
  </parameters>
</test-generation-description>
....

*Example:* For our example the description file would look as follows:

....
<test-generation-description>
  <output-file>test_results.xml</output-file>
  <event-coverage>
    <event>Increase</event>
  </event-coverage>
  <target>count = MAX - 1</target>
  <parameters>
    <maximum-depth>5</maximum-depth>
    <!-- Please note: TIME_OUT (in milliseconds) is not a global time out, it is per trace -->
    <preference name="CLPFD" value="true"/>
    <!-- Please note: TIME_OUT (in milliseconds) is not a global time out, it is per trace -->
    <preference name="TIME_OUT" value="2000"/>
  </parameters>
</test-generation-description>
....

Assuming the test description above is stored in file named
`simple_counter_test_description.xml`, we start the test case generation
with the following call.

....
./probcli.sh simplecounter.mch -test_description simple_counter_test_description.xml
....

====== In the tcl/tk-application

In the tcl/tk-application the test case generation can be started by choosing _Analyse > Testing > constraint-based test case generation..._. In the appearing window one can set the same parameters as described for the command line.

image::MBT-CBC-Dialog-SC.png[]

After a short while you will see the following window:

image::MBT-CBC-Result-SC.png[]

Clicking on _View CBC Test Tree_ will open a window showing the test cases. In this case there is only one test case generated. After just one execution of `Increase` the EndPredicate `count=MAX-1` is satisfied and all operations that we specified are covered, hence the test case's depth is 1.

image::MBT-CBC-Tree-SC.png[]

All three execution variants lead to the same output in the file `test_results.xml`:

....
<extended_test_suite>
  <test_case>
    <initialisation>
      <value type="variable" name="count">1</value>
    </initialisation>
    <step name="Increase">
      <value name="y">4</value>
      <modified name="count">5</modified>
    </step>
  </test_case>
</extended_test_suite>

....

Another model, for which the given `EndPredicate` cannot be satisfied after one step, leads to the following test cases and tree structure of possible traces:

....
<extended_test_suite>
  <test_case>
    <initialisation>
      <value type="variable" name="counter">8</value>
    </initialisation>
    <step name="Double" />
    <step name="Double" />
    <step name="Double" />
  </test_case>
  <test_case>
    <initialisation>
      <value type="variable" name="counter">8</value>
    </initialisation>
    <step name="Double" />
    <step name="Double" />
    <step name="Double" />
    <step name="Double" />
    <step name="Halve" />
  </test_case>
</extended_test_suite>
....
