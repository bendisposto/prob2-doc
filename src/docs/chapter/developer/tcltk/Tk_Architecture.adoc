= The ProB Tcl/Tk cross-language architecture

The ProB Tcl/Tk contains a mixture of Prolog and Tcl/Tk source code. The
core (i.e., the constraint solver, the animation engine, the model
checker, ...) are all written in Prolog (which in turn may call some C
external functions, e.g., for LTL model checking).

We use the SICStus library(tcltk) (see chapter 10.40 of SICStus manual)

Overall, the communication works as follows:

* on startup ProB launches Tcl/Tk; most of the GUI code can be found
inside `main_prob_tcltk_gui.tcl`
* from then on Tcl/Tk controls the GUI and calls Prolog predicates
* Tcl/Tk code calls Prolog using `prolog PRED(…X…Y…)`
* Tcl/Tk then gets result values using `$prolog_variables(X)` or
`$prolog_variables(Y)`. There are only limited Prolog datatypes that can
be transferred from Prolog to Tcl/Tk in this way; see below.
* Tcl/Tk code can also check if a Prolog call was successful, e.g.:
`if [prolog tcltk_backtrack] { … }`
* Tcl/Tk code usually calls predicates with tcltk in their name; but
there are exception (evaluation_view.tcl calls bvisual2 predicates)

The library(tcltk) puts restrictions on what can be transferred from
Prolog to Tcl/Tk and then extracted using `$prolog_variables(VAR)`:

* integer
* atoms (which get translated to Tcl strings)
* lists of integer or atoms
* nested lists of the above; in this case the Prolog code should not
return the list but wrap the list result inside a `list(.)` constructor

[[how-to-add-a-simple-menu-command]]
== How to add a simple menu command

You need to add an entry in the ProB Tcl/Tk menu. The menus are defined
at the top of the file `main_prob_tcltk_gui.tcl`

....
.frmMenu.mnuAnalyse.mnuCoverage add command -label "Number of Values for all Variables" -command {procNrVariableValuesOverStatespace}
....

You also need to define the Tcl/Tk part of your command (probably inside `main_prob_tcltk_gui.tcl`):

....
proc procNrVariableValuesOverStatespace {}
    if [prolog “tcltk_compute_nr_covered_values_for_all_variables(Res)"] {
        procShowErrors
        procShowTable $prolog_variables(Res) "Coverage Table" "Number of Covered Values for Variables" "CoverageVariablesTable" "" ""
    } else {
        procShowErrors
    }
}
....

Observe the use of `prolog` to call Prolog predicates and
`$prolog_variables` to extract return values obtained from Prolog (which
should instantiate the corresponding variable/argument). Also observer
that we call `procShowErrors`, a Tcl/Tk procedure, which extracts all
pending error messages and displays them to the user. procShowTable is a
utility to display a dialog box containing a table.

Finally, we need to define the called Prolog predicate somewhere in the
Prolog code:

....
tcltk_compute_nr_covered_values_for_all_variables(list([list(['Variable', 'Number of Values'])|VL])) :-
    state_space:get_state_space_stats(NrNodes,_,_),
    format('Computing all values in ~w states for all variables~n',[NrNodes]),
    findall(list([ID,Count]),number_of_values_for_variable(ID,Count),VL),
    format('Finished computing all values for all variables~n',[]).
....

The use of format is more for debugging (the output will not be seen by
ProB Tcl/Tk, just on the console (if any) used to launch ProB Tcl/Tk).

The command is now available and ready to use:

[[some-useful-prob-tcltk-procedures]]
== Some useful ProB Tcl/Tk procedures

* procShowErrors: collect all new errors and warnings from the Prolog
error_manager and displays them in a dialog (in batch mode they are
printed on the console only)
* procShowList, procShowTable: pops up dialog boxes to display lists or
tables (lists of lists). Parameters are title of dialog box,…
* procInsertHistoryOptionsState: updates the State, History and
Operations (Options) views by calling Prolog and getting information
about the current state

Note: the Tcl/Tk code is mostly state-less, almost everything is stored
inside Prolog:

* current animation state
* animation history and forward history
* state space (all visited states and transitions)
* all errors that have occurred (stored by the error_manager.pl)
* the current specification
* the state of all the preferences (inside preferences.pl)
* ...
